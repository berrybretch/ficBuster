								<div class="bbWrapper">Posting this here from AH. Quite a bit of catching up to do so I'll post up to the interludes everyday until this thread catches up.<br />
-<br />
Saltpeter, Charcoal and Sulfur. The three ingredients one would need in order to make black powder.<br />
<br />
Saltpeter had been acquired from a very awkward conversation with Harwin Strong. My attempts to distract him from why I needed all the bat poo I could remove from Harrenhal had, for an entire week, had him under the impression we were lovers and started five brand new rumours at court that I’m sure made Alicent all tingly.<br />
<br />
Sulfur had been the next on my list and had left me with a bit of a dilemma. The easiest way to get your hands on Sulfur in Westeros was to buy it from the Dornish. The Hellholt was lousy with the stuff and the Ullers were always happy for the extra income from it’s sale. Unfortunately, that is the easiest method for anyone who isn’t a Targaryen. Another way is distilling Pyrite. Pyrite was mostly found in the Westerlands which meant dealing with the Lannisters. Lannisters or the Dornish, I’m hard pressed to say who are the more traitorous.<br />
<br />
I was saved from my dilemma by Ser Joffrey. No doubt the Ullers are wondering why a scion of the Stormlands requires so much sulfur. He'd refused to set up a reoccurring delivery until I proved that my experiments worked. Bah, I'd show him.<br />
<br />
Charcoal is the easiest. Charcoal burners litter Westeros and it was simple matter of raiding Driftmark for a small supply. Grind all three up, properly measure the ingredients, mix carefully but well and you have yourself the modest little powder that’s going to ensure a certain little sulky brat never lays so much of a finger on the throne that’s rightfully yours.<br />
<br />
Not that I’m taking it personally of course.<br />
<br />
An old pain lanced through my fingers as I prepared to transfer the powder to it’s new home. I paused and flexed them, grimacing at the ache. Grandmaester Runciter had been a genius in more ways than one. Law, Architecture... He could advise on anything a king might need to know but the man had been a god awful doctor. As both I and my mother had discovered. I continued with the exercises until the pain abated.<br />
<br />
Very carefully, I scooped my black powder into the metal casing and tightened the cap. Whilst Dragonstone certainly lives up to it’s name, I’d rather not blow up the castle I’ve only been in possession of for six months. Alicent would love that.<br />
<br />
Not that Dragonstone couldn’t do with a bit of exploding. Dragonstone the castle that is. The island itself wasn’t a problem. What farmland it had was rich and productive, the weather was pleasant and the views at times could be breathtaking. When not in my lab creating the recipe for Alicent’s downfall, I’ve taken to exploring it fully on the back of Syrax.<br />
<br />
The problem is whoever built Dragonstone the castle apparently didn’t share my views on the island. Dragonstone itself had been built in the shadow of the Dragonmont, the towering active volcano that dominated the island. This had several knock-on effects. First it meant that the scenic views, rolling farmlands and gorgeous weather were on the other side of the damnable thing and secondly, the shadow from the mountain cast the castle proper, and the small town surrounding it, into a permanent gloom.<br />
<br />
They’d then topped their monument to poorly thought out architecture in stone dragons. Huge stone dragons, small stone dragons, wall mounted stone dragons, statues of dragons… All made from the same fused black rock I had come to learn was indicative of Valyrian buildings.<br />
<br />
As if that wasn’t enough, later architects had decided there weren't enough dragons and had carved more into the walls, the floors, railings and banisters. No wonder Stannis had gone mad living here and if he was actually Azor Ahai and did have the power to wake dragons from stone then he was going to be a one man second coming of the bloody freehold.<br />
<br />
Two guards in Targaryen livery fell into step behind me as a left the lab with my creation tucked under my arm. One of the many stewards of Dragonstone would ensure the rooms were cleaned and locked. Not that any totally-not-Alicent’s-spies would be able to figure out what I was doing before it was too late. Still, this is Westeros and it never hurts to be pro-active about you enemies.<br />
<br />
I realised I was scowling when a maid all but leapt out of my way. I would have to check that. I rearranged my face into what I hoped was polite smile and made my way to the small courtyard I’d had cleared for testing. The corridor that lead to the exit had the look of one that had been neglected since the Red Keep had been constructed.<br />
<br />
My two guards took up positions by the door, out of the way. Happily, my earlier instructions for the set up had been heeded and a brazier was merrily burning away. It was heading towards late afternoon and I probably shouldn’t be testing things so close to the evening meal. It was considered rude and Lord Corlys was always ready to point out my shortcomings.<br />
<br />
I poured a modest amount of powder onto the flagstone, before withdrawing and retrieved a wooden splint. I had to be extra careful here. All my work would be for nothing if I set myself alight. Gently, I lowered the splint into the powder before stepping even further back.<br />
<br />
Generally, Black powder will ignite if you look at it wrong. In the open, like mine, it should burn. Confined however, it produces an explosion which is what makes it useful for flinging bits of metal about at high speed.<br />
<br />
At least that was what it was supposed to do.<br />
<br />
I could only watch with a sinking sort of horror as the flame sputtered and died amongst the completely unignited and very much not on fire powder. From the corner, I heard my guards move to intercept someone. I stared at the unburnt spot and tried to set my emotions in order.<br />
<br />
Frustration: Check<br />
Something weirdly close to grief: Check<br />
A sinking feeling that I have to face the Dance of Dragons without my easy mode solution of firearms: Also check.<br />
<br />
Someone up there is laughing at me, I just know it.<br />
<br />
“Rhaenyra!”<br />
<br />
I jumped as a hand collided with my shoulder, pulling me from my one woman self-pity party. Unsurprisingly, it was yet another problem I would have to deal with before I could drop-kick Alicent all the way back to the Hightower. Laenor. Another set of unfortunate feelings rose up inside me and I resisted the urge to clock him for taking my pity party and switching it to a ‘oh no original Rhaenyra is definitely still here somewhere’ existential horror.<br />
<br />
“What?” I bit out. I don’t even know my own age anymore but I’m damn sure I’m too young to be dealing with the question of whether I’m keeping someone prisoner inside their own body or the knowledge that a continent spanning super war is on it’s way because Alicent is raging b- bad person.<br />
<br />
“My Lord Father has requested your presence for an early dinner.”<br />
<br />
Ignoring how breathtakingly rude it is for Lord Corlys to be 'requesting' things in my own damn castle, Laenor doesn’t even look the slightest bit apologetic for the delivery of bad news. I cast another glance at the black powder with the vain hope that maybe it will set alight and the first time was somehow a fluke. It remained inert and I sighed heavily before I could stop myself.<br />
<br />
“Did your experiment not go to plan?” asked Laenor, peering around me.<br />
<br />
I gestured to the black powder again with another sigh and he gives me a sympathetic look.<br />
<br />
“Sorry it didn’t work out. Perhaps this is a sign that Alchemy should not be a path to the throne.”<br />
<br />
He was trying to sound conciliatory but it wasn't hard to infer he found to whole business distasteful. He may be a gay man in the heart of grimderp Westeros but beyond matters of inheritance and love, he was remarkably closed minded.<br />
<br />
I fixed him with what I hoped was an intimidating glare. He raised his hands in mock surrender before pushing some of his long silver hair from his face.<br />
<br />
The Rhaenyra in me was thrilled. He was a beautiful man, tall with delicate features and long silver hair. His eyes were the typical Valyrian violet and he held himself in a particularly regal manner. I had, thankfully, failed to somehow butterfly away Rhaenyra’s beauty. Trust me, she had well deserved her title of ‘Realm’s Delight’. A lifetime of lessons in deportment had meant I could match Laenor’s regal grace with my own. On the surface, we were a striking couple.<br />
<br />
The current power couple of Westeros.<br />
<br />
“It’s beginning to be spoken about at court,” he continued. I frowned. He didn’t have to say who was talking about it. It was Alicent, it was always Alicent. My Father would only intervene if anything became blatant and even then he was unlikely to do anything that would actually protect me. I had seen it all play out in the past and in all likeliness, I would see it play out again. I flexed my fingers as they throbbed again in reminder.<br />
<br />
“Perhaps it is time for you to find someone-”<br />
<br />
I cut him off with a wave. I knew how that had gone for the original Rhaenyra. Three obvious bastards had tanked her support harder than anything Alicent could have ever done. Something I know would have tickled orginal Alicent pink if this Alicent was anything to go by.<br />
<br />
“I have already told you-” Laenor cut me of this time, his face twisted in unhappiness.<br />
<br />
“I can not. I have already explained. I can not.” I understood and sympathised to a degree. He was a gay man and no amount of closing his eyes and thinking of Driftmark was going to change that. It still didn’t change the fact that bearing anyone else’s children was a risk I could not take.<br />
<br />
“I’m not about to have children now anyway, Laenor. It’s too early. Childbirth killed both my mother and her mother too. We have a few years to find a solution.”<br />
<br />
He didn’t look convinced. That was probably Lord Corlys’ doing. No doubt he was hammering the need for a quick heir into his son’s head. In canon, Rhaenyra had already been pregnant with Jacaerys by this point. I suppose the lack of heir was spooking my so called ‘greatest supporter’.<br />
<br />
“I fear that will not placate the Factions at court,” replied Laenor, meaning Lord Corlys even if he didn't actually mean to imply that.<br />
<br />
On that last miserable note, I guided him back out of the courtyard, leaving orders for the stewards to clear the mess and to be careful with the powder.</div>

								<div class="bbWrapper">Laenor left me at the entrance to my rooms to go and prepare himself. A gaggle of maids soon surrounded me and I let myself relax under their ministrations. My hair was unbound and brushed, the dirt I hadn’t notice wiped away with a wash cloth and then the dresses were brought forward.<br />
<br />
In a previous life, I’d hated dresses. I’d hated wearing them, hated trying to move in them and especially hated how no matter the fabric they pulled and itched. The Rhaenyra in me loved dresses, loved being attended to, adored the idea of court fashion.<br />
<br />
I’d been startled to say the least when I’d realised I actually looked forward to dress fittings. Even more so when my new fashion conscious eye could pick out courtly attire and what it meant.<br />
<br />
“Nothing to ostentatious tonight, Genna.” The maid in question curtsied and indicated for a black dress embroidered with red dragons. Another maid brought forth a mantle of red that evoked the style common to the Vale. Too tired to assess whether that would offend my dear Goodfather or not, I gave my assent.<br />
<br />
The whole affair took about an hour. Outside of the window, the sun was beginning to set. I stopped to watch it. I wasn’t in any particular hurry and I beyond tired of dealing with Corlys. I needed a few moments just to myself. What would I do if I couldn’t get the Black Powder to work?<br />
<br />
After my brief respite, I made my way to the private dining rooms. Laenor was not present yet but Lord Corlys and his wife were. I bit back a groan and hoped it hadn’t shown on my face. Corlys greeted me with his usual taciturn nod whilst his wife pulled me into a hug. I returned it happily. For all that I disliked Corlys, I loved Rhaenys.<br />
<br />
“You look well! Any chance of good news?” she asked, with a friendly nudge as we sat down. Sometimes I wondered what the hell went on in their heads, that they could miss Laenor’s planet sized see-through closet. At the mention of heirs though, I became the subject of the Lord of Driftmark’s laser-like focus.<br />
<br />
I took a sip of wine before answering.<br />
<br />
“Not yet Lady Rhaenys but I pray to the Mother that I will be blessed soon.” When in doubt, invoke religion. It’s amazing how many Westerosi nobles dislike talking about religion.<br />
<br />
“As do I,” echoed Laenor as he finally entered. He seated himself next to me after depositing a quick kiss on his Mother’s temple.<br />
<br />
“Praying won’t help,” said Corlys, breaking his silence at last. Laenor tensed up, as did Rhaenys.<br />
<br />
“Father-”<br />
<br />
“No, Laenor. You have been married for nearly half a year now. You think the servants do not speak? They do and the realm is eager to listen. And what things they speak of? A Lord that has never visited his Lady’s bed chambers, A Princess who is happier to play with queer dusts and strange powders like some sort of alchemist!”<br />
<br />
My fingers gave a throb of agony as my hand tightened around the goblet. Around us, the Stewards were doing their best to seem as unobtrusive as possible. How many were Alicent’s? How much could I say in their presence?<br />
<br />
“Corlys,” hissed Rhaenys, her tone promising retribution. The Lord set his jaw, meeting his wife’s eyes and then his son’s. Both lost the ensuing staring match.<br />
<br />
He turned his eyes on me. He was challenging me, although what he hoped to achieve was beyond me.<br />
<br />
Our staring match was interrupted by the arrival of the meal itself. His eyes flickered for a moment, resting on the hand that held my wine before looking away entirely. I realised that my hand was still clenched tightly around the goblet, so much so that my fingers had turned white.<br />
<br />
I couldn’t tell who had won that match of wills. Instead of agonising over it, I offered Laenor a smile before helping myself. Dinner tonight was beef pie accompanied by a multitude of green vegetables. Delicious but my mind was whirring with other thoughts.<br />
<br />
Why did he have to pick tonight of all nights? After today’s failure… Was that why he had picked it? No. He had sent Laenor before the Power had failed to ignite. Perhaps he knew I had begun testing today and wished to gauge my work before deciding to disapprove?<br />
<br />
That sounded more in line with what I knew about the Sea Snake.<br />
<br />
After the last of his famous voyages he’d come back to Westeros and assumed the title of Lord of the Tides. His treasures had made his House wealthy and Lord Corlys had proved himself as good a ruler as he had a sailor. He’d invested, begun construction on High Tide and married a Targaryen Princess.<br />
<br />
At the time, it had been assumed by many that Lady Rhaenys would inherit the Throne and Lord Corlys had made it apparent to all who would listen that he was ready to fight her battles. The fact that he had proceeded to do so was something of a problem.<br />
<br />
None of the books I had read had ever gone into detail about it but it seems the conflict between Aemon’s line and Baelon’s line had begun far earlier than the Grand Council of 101AC. As a youth, Rhaenys had climbed atop Meleys soon after Princess Alyssa’s death. To anyone unfamiliar with the customs of the Valyrian Freehold, this did not appear to be a problem.<br />
<br />
However, I had soon been told otherwise. A dragon was personal thing, when a family member died custom dictated that those close to the deceased should have first refusal on the dragon. The fact that Rhaenys had so blatantly ignored this had enraged Prince Baelon as well as Prince Daemon. It had taken some not inconsiderable diplomacy from Prince Aemon to ensure it did not become an Incident.<br />
<br />
But damage had been done. When Prince Aemon died on Tarth, Daemon claimed Caraxes in revenge. I think that Rhaenys wouldn’t have cared had she not learnt soon after that Jaehaerys had stripped Dragonstone and the Title of Heir from her. Instead, the loss of Caraxes for her own daughter, the just born Laena, had become symbolic of her loss no matter how unreasonable it was to expect a babe to claim a dragon.<br />
<br />
So much so that both Corlys and Rhaenys were eager to look the other way when the seven year old Laena claimed Vhagar. When her claiming of the mighty beast had come to light, Viserys had to physically restrain an enraged Daemon. The fact that the target of his ire was seven year old girl, one he was happy to threaten violence upon did not go down well with the Court. Or Jaehaerys. The Old King had him confined to his rooms for a week.<br />
<br />
Corlys hadn’t taken the incident well regardless of whether Daemon had been punished or not. He and Daemon had nearly started a civil war during the Great Council and it took years for matters to thaw between them. Even then it had been a chance thing. An icily correct visit to court and an unplanned drunken night had given birth the Conquest of the Stepstones. I was given to understand the early years of the Conquest had been fraught with arguments and rivalry even then. They’d managed to reconcile however.<br />
<br />
For all that Corlys blamed neither brother for the wrong done to his wife, there was still an empty chair on Viserys’ small council. Alicent was desperate to fill it with a Redwyne but Viserys refused, telling anyone who asked that the title of Master of Ships belonged to Corlys and would be waiting for him when Corlys came to claim it.<br />
<br />
That Corlys had sworn he would not take the title until his wife and children’s rights were restored, that he would not aid a usurper, seemed not to bother Viserys overly much.<br />
<br />
I took a drink of wine and used it to covertly scan the Lord of the Tides. He was in his early sixties but was still as healthy and as active of a man half his age. His skin was weathered by the sea, something he was eager to show off as he eschewed any particular fashion, opting for the garb of sailor. Admittedly, the fabrics used were silk and satin. He wasn’t as handsome as his son, his features were thicker than the normal aquiline Valyrian look but I’d imagine he still many a maiden blushing.<br />
<br />
He certainly had the Rhaenyra in me blushing. The dinner proceeded in an awkward silence, with no one quite willing to break it. Laenor opened his mouth a couple of times but seems to back down before the words made their way out.<br />
<br />
I forced myself to focus. That Corlys was trying to assert authority over me was obvious. The fact that he had all but usurped the castle from me was annoying. I’d been so focused on the powder… I pulled my thoughts away. This needed to be about Corlys.<br />
<br />
Oh, of course. He can’t be seen involving himself to much in the goings on of the court. He publicly declared his withdrawal from it several times. He’s backed himself into a corner with hasty declarations made years ago that his own pride won’t allow him to forswear. Controlling a future Queen is fine and dandy but I think what he really wants is the Black faction.<br />
<br />
I resist the urge to groan at that. The Black faction. The one I’d been neglecting in my haste to develop the Black Powder. I’d reasoned it all away in my head that I wouldn’t need the Lords of Westeros with dragons, guns and canons.<br />
<br />
I’d messed it up somehow. I was certain I had the mixture right though. Even if I wasn’t exact there still should have been some reaction, something I could use to refine it further.<br />
<br />
Laenor cleared his throat. The rooms attention swung towards him.<br />
<br />
“Out of curiosity, what was your experiment today supposed to do?” he asked. I took a sip of wine to give myself time to think. In the corner, Rhaenys leant forward slightly, evidently eager for anything that would alleviate the oppressive atmosphere that had sprung up.<br />
<br />
“It was supposed to burn or explode.” I replied, seeing no way out. Laenor’s eyebrows drew together.<br />
<br />
“Explode. Forgive me, Rhaenyra, but I do not see the advantage?” Laenor’s face was scrunched up in confusion. Damn him, even comically confused he was beautiful.<br />
<br />
“Ah. Well… I had hoped to use it to create new artillery.” I managed lamely. At that, Corlys put his goblet down and leant forward.<br />
<br />
“How would this have worked?” He asked. I couldn’t tell if he was genuinely interested or not. Hopefully, he was. For all that he was a curmudgeon, his support would be priceless. His current focus was the Stepstones. If I was going to have to play the political game after all, the earlier I could use him as an active Black, the better.<br />
<br />
“Simply? A long metal tube with lead shot. The Black powder explodes and launches the shot out of the tube at high speed.” I explained. I was not going to tell him that early canons had a bad habit of exploding the people using them at the same time.<br />
<br />
“But the powder doesn’t work.” There was reprimand in his tone. I kept the glare from my face barely. I’d walked right into a trap in my haste to trap him.<br />
<br />
“I must have done something wrong. I can fix i-”<br />
<br />
“How would this new artillery even help your cause? You ride a dragon, your Goodmother rides a dragon and your husband rides a dragon. I would suggest you leave the art of explosions to the Alchemists Guild.”<br />
<br />
Realisation hit me like a punch to the face. I barely heard Rhaenys’ tart response.<br />
<br />
The Alchemists Guild. I was an idiot. By the time of Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon they were a sad shadow of their former glory but right now? Right now they were at the height of their power. Dragons weren’t extinct and their knowledge of magic and science could rival that of a Citadel trained Maester.<br />
<br />
I took a long gulp of wine to hide my grin. If anyone could help me perfect the Black Powder it would be the Alchemists. Oh, and what a coincidence, I had the perfect excuse to show up on Viserys’ doorstep. Thanks Alicent!<br />
<br />
“Perhaps a change of subject is in order,” I said, forestalling the brewing argument between the Queen Who Never Was and the Sea Snake. “I have actually been wondering if it might be worth travelling to King’s Landing. After all, I have a new brother now and I’d be a poor sister if I didn’t at least go and see him.”<br />
<br />
“I wasn’t aware you were fond of your brothers?” said Rhaenys. She had a point. The last male relative I’d had any fondness for had been Prince Baelon. If one did not count Laenor, he was the only male relative I had ever had any fondness for.<br />
<br />
“Brother or no, you’re better of staying away from that pit.” Corlys growled. His look of disapproval was back. I watched as he speared a vegetable with uncalled for violence.<br />
<br />
“If scurrilous rumours are circulating in the capital perhaps it’s best to go there and make a show of it.” Laenor cut in. Corlys frowned as his earlier argument was flung back at him with an uncharacteristic show of backbone from his son.<br />
<br />
“It wouldn’t hurt to touch base with my supporters either.” I added. I knew I’d been correct about his motives when Corlys reacted like a shark that had scented blood in the water. He drummed his fingers on the table before nodding.<br />
<br />
“It seems appropriate,” he admitted. “As much as they should come to you.”<br />
<br />
“Good luck with that, dear husband. The lords of Westeros are prickly bunch. They don’t like being summoned like common servants.” chuckled Rhaenys. As the atmosphere became less tense she’d begun relaxing. Corlys merely snorted in response.<br />
<br />
Chilled fruit was served soon after.<br />
<br />
“Regardless of your plans, it seems I can not stay here for much longer. That is why I requested this meal tonight. I need to return to the Stepstones and I’ve tarried here for as long as possible.”<br />
<br />
In response to Corlys’ statement, Rhaenys sighed and looked harried. Laenor leant forth and, surprisingly, laid a gentle hand over mine.<br />
<br />
“Is there news regarding Prince Daemon?” he asked. I tensed and Laenor’s hand tightened about mine. The fingers of my right hand ached. I was glad Corlys had waited until the main meal was over with as at the mention of my uncle, my appetite fled. Rhaenys shot me a pained look.<br />
<br />
“It seems the pirates once thought routed have gathered under a new banner. They will launch an attack on Bloodstone before the year is out.” Corlys explained.<br />
<br />
“The Triarchy?” asked Laenor. I wasn’t paying attention though. I could not deal with thoughts of him tonight. Not after the failure of the powder and Corlys’ antics.<br />
<br />
“I shall retire.” I announced, rising to my feet. If Corlys was surprised by this, he did not show it. Instead, he nodded his permission.<br />
<br />
The Rhaenyra in me wanted to slap him. This was my castle, not his. I could not, of course. I would wait until he was gone and route out the men and women he had bought. Ser Joffrey was uncommonly good at finding and locating those with lose tongues and it would be a nice distraction from his romantic troubles. Killing them was too much but perhaps a one-way ride to Driftmark with a notice that Corlys had forgotten some of his men and women.<br />
<br />
“Laenor, why don’t you accompany your wife tonight.”<br />
<br />
For all that it was put forward as a suggestion, it was a command. One Laenor leapt to obey, his earlier show of backbone forgotten in haste to be out from underneath the all-knowing eye of his Father. I pictured his face as he read the message informing him that I had severed his power base in Dragonstone without death or violence before offering Laenor a comforting smile.<br />
<br />
Evidently a long night’s sleep and time to think up a plan were not on the cards today then.</div>

								<div class="bbWrapper">We didn’t speak as we made our way back to my rooms. I wanted to point out that Lord Corlys had gone so far beyond propriety tonight that he was possibly approaching politeness from the other side but to do so before Joffrey’s spring cleaning would be stupid. Corlys wouldn’t take it personally but he’d absolutely use it against me.<br />
<br />
I guided Laenor inside my rooms and dismissed the maids and servants with a final request for a pitcher of wine. My lord husband was tense, as if he were made of glass. I directed him to a chair and took a seat opposite him. We did not speak until the steward delivered the pitcher and two goblets. Even then we both had made our way through our first goblet before I started, having spent the silence searching for the right approach.<br />
<br />
“I do believe your Lord Father was five minutes away from suggesting he attend to the matter of an heir personally as well,” My voice wasn’t quite the dry, scathing tone I was going for but it worked to startle Laenor from his funk. He gave a sharp, short laugh.<br />
<br />
“Mother would feed him to Meleys,” I could see that. Lady Rhaenys had a fierce temper and according to Laena and Laenor, many a maid had been dismissed from their roles at High Tide.<br />
<br />
“We can not keep on like this, Laenor,” I told him in the silence after. The man nodded solemnly. “I will stick by my plan to wait for an heir but you must provide it.”<br />
<br />
He sighed heavily and poured himself more wine before throwing back nearly half the goblet. I felt sorry for him, I truly did. He’d found his true love and lost him all in one year. Ser Joffrey may not have died when Criston Cole struck him down but what was left was a pale shadow compared to the man before. Then, whilst dealing with that loss, he’d had to navigate married life with increased duties on Driftmark.<br />
<br />
“I do not know how but I will do my best. Do the Alchemists not know of some potion?” His voice was strangely hopeful. I frowned as I thought. Hadn’t Melisandre said that she had charms that could interest a man? Or was I just making that up.<br />
<br />
“I’m not sure. I intend to visit them discreetly whilst we are in King’s Landing but I think we must discuss what comes after,” He placed his goblet down and leant forward.<br />
<br />
“What did you have in mind?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Today has been something of a wake up call. If the Black Powder doesn’t work then I have no back-up plan to ensure my ascent to the throne.” Laenor nodded in response. I resisted the urge to sigh. He was a clever man but totally under father’s thumb. If I was going to pull him from Corlys’ orbit and into mine I needed to involve him.<br />
<br />
“What do you think is the best course of action?” I asked and he seemed surprised I had. He seemed to think it over for some time, wine forgotten. Hints of the mind Corlys wanted in his son but was forever crushing with his own oversized ego poking through I supposed.<br />
<br />
“We should start with the Crownlands.” He began slowly. At my questioning look, he elaborated. “Whoever controls the Crownlands controls King’s Landing. If war does break out, we will need King’s Landing if we wish to have any chance of winning. Do you know what Lords we can rely on?”<br />
<br />
I thought back to the original timeline. Most of Rhaenyra’s support had come from the northern regions whilst Aegon’s had been mostly southern. That was proving true in my case as well. The fledgling Black cause was mostly made up of the Crownland houses sworn to Dragonstone and Vale lords.<br />
<br />
“My cousin will likely side with me,” I pointed out.<br />
<br />
“Lady Jeyne has only recently obtained her majority and is already embroiled in a succession dispute herself. There’s also the chance that raids by the mountain clans could pull their armies away at a critical time.” Damn him, he was right. Jeyne had the support of the majority of the Vale lords but there were a few that either opposed her outright or did not care to offer any support.<br />
<br />
“Perhaps an offer of support. A letter to my cousin to assure her that I will ensure her rights are respected should armed conflict break out.” Laenor nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
“I can try and obtain permission from Father to send overly ambitious male relatives to the Stepstones? It would give Lady Jeyne an excuse to cut them off from their support bases in the Vale. There’s still the matter of the Mountain Clansman though.”<br />
<br />
The Mountain Clansman of the Vale were the biggest problem for a stronger Vale. Dealing with them would not be easy. They were First Men who believed that the Vale was rightfully their’s and viewed all Andals as trespassers. The problem with that line of thought was that by now, the Andals had been here for thousands of years. You couldn’t just ship them off back to Andalos.<br />
<br />
For most of the time, the Clansmen were willing to sit in their hidden villages and attack only the remotest of locations. When Autumn came however, they would swarm down from the mountains into the Vale of Arryn proper and carry out mass raiding for food and women. Jeyne’s father and brother had died whilst attempting to mount a response to the Autumn raiding. A story every House in the Vale could relate too.<br />
<br />
They refused all diplomacy, they killed people, drove the rest from their homes, stole women and the aftermaths of their attacks often saw even more people dying due to lack of food and adequate shelter. Although it revolted me, they would have to be eliminated. I said as much to Laenor, who merely shook his head.<br />
<br />
“The Arryn’s have been saying that for centuries. Although, I suppose they’ve never had a dragon before,” he mused. Suddenly, I wish we’d had this meeting around the Painted Table. It would have been much cooler.<br />
<br />
“So we cultivate allies in the Crownlands and the Vale as our first step. Give ourselves a core of loyal lords and use the strengthened Black faction to pull in more from other regions,” I concluded. It would work as a solid opening move, politically.<br />
<br />
Although, even if Black Powder was behaving strange, other things might not be. What was the first thing everyone did in the stories? Seed drill. There were other areas that could be uplifted, not just military technology.<br />
<br />
“What about glass houses?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Glass houses? I admit such things would be useful for luring Northern lords to our side,” his voice clearly laying out that he thought the Northern Lords would be about as useful as a chocolate teapot “But they are too expensive. To buy and for the Northern Lords to maintain.”<br />
<br />
“Not if we can make it ourselves.” Westeros was fully capable of making glass. The issue is that it was glass of a truly awful quality. Most glass was bought and shipped from Myr, which drove the prices to truly eye watering heights.<br />
<br />
“You believe your Alchemy could give us the ability to make glass?” he asked, doubtfully. I wasn’t surprised, Myr kept the glass making secrets close to their chest. Slaves were bought as children and raised into the profession, those of them that tried to run away were given horrific punishment and those that stayed and were obedient were given a far better life than even some of the free citizens of Myr. A gilded cage but a cage none the less.<br />
<br />
I, however, had an advantage no Westerosi glass maker had.<br />
<br />
When I had awoken as Rhaenyra, I had put as much as I remembered of modern technology to paper. Whilst the knowledge of glass creation was not exactly something I could remember now I knew I’d written down some details about it’s creation. Along with a whole treasure trove of technology I could use for the carrot part of a ‘carrot and stick’ routine with the lords of Westeros.<br />
<br />
The stick part would, of course, be Syrax.<br />
<br />
“I can’t. I came into possession of a book when I was younger. A very poor translation of an older work from the Valyrian Freehold. I copied as much as possible but it was very damaged. It contained many useful technologies but the instructions were rather garbled. I know glass was in there somewhere,” When in doubt imply that your operating on secrets obtained from the Freehold. Anyone with even a drop of Valyrian blood has a tendency to buy it hook, line and sinker.<br />
<br />
It would also cover for the fact that I hadn’t exactly remembered many of the instructions. Not that I could remember anything about it now, of course. When I had been four and a fresh, newcomer to Westeros the information had been fresh in my mind but even fresh it was hardly a step by step guide to an uplift.<br />
<br />
Oh. Balls.<br />
<br />
I’d hidden it in a tunnel accessible from my old room. My old room in the Tower of the Hand<br />
<br />
The current occupant of the Tower was Lyonel Strong and his sons, Harwin and Larys. Larys was easy to deal with. He was intelligent and he enjoyed engaging in intelligent conversation without the pity or mocking that he usually dealt with due to his Clubfoot.<br />
<br />
Harwin was a whole different problem. My need for saltpetre had seen me negotiate for access to Harrenhal. In my haste, I may have accidentally given Harwin the idea I was interested in more than a simple trade. The result had been awkward and Alicent had probably gone to sleep laughing for months afterwards.<br />
<br />
“Technologies?”<br />
<br />
Oh, I used an anachronism, didn’t I?<br />
<br />
“That is what the book called them,” I replied with a shrug after the initial moment of panic had worm off.<br />
<br />
“Well regardless of the terms a book about Valyrian ‘technologies’ would be invaluable. Do you still have the copy you made?” he asked, eagerly.<br />
<br />
“That would be the issue.” I explained the issue with the current location and he sighed.<br />
<br />
“The matter with Harwin was ill-done but it can’t be helped now. We must retrieve your copy. Once we have it we can use the information to strengthen our allies and bind them to our cause,” He looked more animated now than I’d ever seen him and I’d seen him as a rambunctious seven year old that wanted to explore the secret passages of the Red Keep.<br />
<br />
“Did your notion of Black Powder come from the book?” he asked after settling down.<br />
<br />
“It did. As did the notion of the canon. They put them on ships, you know?” I informed him.<br />
<br />
“Imagine that? Pirates would never be a problem again,” he murmured.<br />
<br />
I poured us some more wine. He took the goblet gratefully and took a sip. I took my own large gulp before addressing the next part of things.<br />
<br />
“We have some solid political strategies down but we must talk personal.” It was like letting air out of a balloon as he seemed to literally deflate.<br />
<br />
“Didn’t we already decide we were waiting for heirs?” he almost whined.<br />
<br />
“Not that. I’m talking about the image we project to the world at large. As much as it pains me to admit, Lord Corlys was right.” Oh boy did it pain me to say that. “You spend your time on Driftmark up to your ears in paperwork and I spend mine of Dragonstone up to my ears in-”<br />
<br />
“Bat crap,” Laenor interrupted.<br />
<br />
“Queer dusts and strange powders,” I finished, overlooking his interruption. He smiled and took a drink of his wine once more.<br />
<br />
“What would you have us do?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Play the husband. We need to be seen together. Perhaps we could fly Syrax and Seasmoke regularly? And of course, we will need to regularly share a bed-”<br />
<br />
“I thought you said this wasn’t about heirs,” he said with a petulant air.<br />
<br />
“Stop interrupting me. As I was saying, we need the appearance of a loving couple. One that had a rocky start perhaps but nevertheless…” I trailed of and he nodded as it sank in.<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t mind flying with you regularly. Mother says you have the makings of an excellent rider,” I was beginning to think the heirs situation was something of a hot button issue for Laenor. Whenever the conversation even so much as touched on it he became as tense as a cat in a room full of rocking chairs. His relief when steering away from the topic was palpable. His entire demeanour changed in on instant to the next.<br />
<br />
“I must thank Rhaenys for her compliment tomorrow. I do, however, remember her telling me that I handled Syrax as gracefully as a rock.”<br />
<br />
That made Laenor laugh. Learning to ride from Lady Rhaenys had been fun. Not so much with my other teacher. I flexed my hand as it throbbed. After another hour of talking, mostly anecdotes about dragons and mothers, we made our way to bed for a hopefully peaceful nights sleep.</div>

								<div class="bbWrapper">Laenor left my rooms as early as was proper. I made a point of kissing him where the maids could see and although I could admit he wasn’t an unpleasant kisser, I could tell from the slight tensing that he’d rather I was Joffrey. Hopefully, it would get back to Corlys and curb some of the ‘talking’ going on.<br />
<br />
After that I allowed a batch of giggly maids to attend to me. If we were to head to King’s Landing soon then preparations had to be made. Although I had a dragon, a royal could not just leap on it’s back and leave. I required dresses, attendants, guards, supplies, gifts… The list was almost endless.<br />
<br />
An hour long meeting with castellan gave me a partial solution to the dilemma. Laenor and I would fly tomorrow with the bare essentials and our ship would follow along afterwards. There would be a gap of a few days but Viserys had never minded covering for that in the past.<br />
<br />
After laying out what would need to be loaded onto the dragons and what the ship would be bringing. The longest part was deciding on appropriate gifts for me siblings. I finally settled on a dagger with a dragon hilt inlaid with emeralds for Aegon, a collection of really fancy thread for Helaena, a wooden sword and shield for Aemond and the usual assortment of rattles one gave to a newborn for Daeron.<br />
<br />
I was willing to admit pride as I made my way to the set of rooms I’d claimed as an office space. One of the first things I’d done when arriving on Dragonstone had been to set up an actual bureaucracy so that no part of the castle lacked oversight. That my staff could now plan and enact royal travel with a days notice was testament to my success.<br />
<br />
Apparently, getting too smug had attracted the Gods attention and they’d decided to knock me down a peg or two because as I returned to my office I found Rhaenys waiting outside. Don’t get me wrong, I loved Rhaenys. She was blunt, wore her heart on her sleeve and was absolutely ready to fight 100% of the time.<br />
<br />
For all that it was easy to write Rhaenya off as a player in the Game of Thrones, She was just as dangerous as Corlys and twice as ambitious. She wasn’t cruel though. If she could help someone she would and I couldn’t forget what she’d risked when she’d stood before my Father and the Court and denounced my Uncle with words that, had they come from anyone else, were a good way of getting your tongue removed.<br />
<br />
She ushered herself in after me, waving away the offer for refreshment. Before I sat down to deal with her, I sent a runner to Ser Joffrey to order him to attend to me at his earliest convenience.<br />
<br />
“I’ll be heading off for Driftmark soon enough. I came to let you know I’ll be sending my girl to you in King’s Landing,” she informed me as she took a seat.<br />
<br />
That was unusual, Laena was adventurous. She mostly spent her time flying on her dragon, planning to fly somewhere on her dragon or sightseeing in places she had flown to on her dragon.<br />
<br />
“I always look forward to seeing cousin Laena but I was given to believe she was planning a trip to Pentos.” At least that had been Laenor’s report a couple of days ago when he and his family sans Laena had arrived.<br />
<br />
“Corlys put a halt to it when he heard about the trouble on the Stepstones. He wanted one of us on Driftmark in case of trouble but I’ve offered to step in,” Rhaenys explained. I raised an eyebrow. That did explain why Rhaenys was sending her to me rather than to Pentos but didn’t explain why she was leaving her husband a dragon short in the face on renewed hostilities.<br />
<br />
“Did Lady Laena cancel her plans to fly to Pentos?” I asked. Rhaenys sighed and shook her head.<br />
<br />
“She’s too into flying. She needs something to tether her to Westeros and the Seven knows her Father isn’t going to deal with it anytime soon. It’s a Mother’s hope she might find someone in court worth breaking that damnable contract for. Besides, having a beautiful maiden to flaunt won’t exactly hurt your cause.”<br />
<br />
I see. Rhaenys and Corlys are having differences again. From what I’ve gleaned from Laena and Laenor’s slip ups, this is a usual occurrence. They love one another and are a surprisingly good team politically despite their hugely differing attitudes towards life but every now and again they butt heads and reenact Jaehaerys and Alysanne’s Great Quarrels. Still, Rhaenys is right, Laena is Lordling bait and so I sent a message off to the castellan once she'd left to advise him to co-ordinate with Laenor’s men about his sister.<br />
<br />
I was half way through the harbour master’s report regarding a small collision that had occurred yesterday when Ser Joffrey Lonmouth limped in, leaning heavily on his stick. His brown hair was clipped short and his face was clean-shaven. The clothes he wore were a better fit for an academic than the knight he was. A far cry from the look he bore when I first met him.<br />
<br />
Joffrey then had been brash and proud with long hair he’d had in a knot and a well-groomed beard. He’d duelled a few squires who’d made remarks about him and Laenor and on the same day made it clear to me that Laenor was his and that he wasn’t in the mood to share. I’d warned them both about Criston. My warning had saved Ser Joffrey’s life but he’d been crippled in the aftermath. The brash youth was gone and I had only my inability to manage Criston to blame.<br />
<br />
Like the Black Powder, he was another failure. I’d assumed that as long as I didn’t encourage him or openly act ‘unchaste’ he’d remain loyal. That his betrayal had been fuelled by Rhaenyra’s behaviour in the original time line. I’d been proved wrong and I should have seen it coming.<br />
<br />
The Kingsguard had been in love with me. He had created a story in his head that I was the beautiful Princess and he the dashing Knight. That, somehow, I would eventually end up with him. When Uncle Daemon had blown in, Ser Criston had been my shield in truth. When my betrothal had been announced he’d expected to defend me again.<br />
<br />
He’d come to me before the wedding and laid out a plan to flee to the Disputed Lands. There, he claimed, he would win fame as a mercenary so that he could ensure I had everything I deserved. I had done my best but it hadn’t been enough. I had not been diplomatic in my refusal, I had been too shocked that I had missed all the warning signs even though I had known something would happen.<br />
<br />
I should have flattered him, soothed his hurt ego and rejected him gently. I hadn’t and his desperate love had turned to hate and rage. Laenor had been the target and since he couldn’t directly harm Laenor, he’d tried to kill Ser Joffrey. A ‘take what’s mine and I’ll take what’s yours’ scenario. He’d gunned for Joffrey, ignored countless other Knights in the melee and it had been all that Joffrey could do to even survive.<br />
<br />
In the aftermath, it did not seem to matter how much Laenor professed he did care about the injury, how he loved him, Ser Joffrey would not believe him. He’d come to me and begged my pardon for not listening to me and offered to serve in my household, so that he would not be burden to his family. I had agreed. I had gotten Criston Cole so wrong and it had destroyed someone in turn. I felt guilty. I couldn’t help but hope that with a little bit of time to realise he could be useful as something other than a fighter that he’d find his way back to Laenor.<br />
<br />
“You called for me, your grace?” he asked as he lowered himself into the chair with difficulty. I made a show of filing the report before turning my attention to him as finished making himself comfortable.<br />
<br />
“I will be heading to King’s Landing tomorrow. I’ve made the material arrangements with the castellan but I have some tasks for you whilst I’m gone.” There was no point asking how he was or asking nicely. He would take it as pity and sulk for weeks.<br />
<br />
“Will Ser Laenor be departing with you?” he asked, a note of longing in his voice. I brushed over it.<br />
<br />
“He will. We’re hoping to touch base with loyal lords at court, amongst other things,” I replied, ignoring the look on his face. “As for Dragonstone, it seems Lord Corlys has people here. I want every single one of his informers shipped to Driftmark.”<br />
<br />
Joffrey ran a hand through his short hair and looked thoughtful.<br />
<br />
“I did think he was overstepping his mark but you didn’t give orders to the contrary so I didn’t think to address the issue. I would advise we don’t send them all though. It would be a solid plan to keep a few in place to feed misinformation to our enemies.”<br />
<br />
That was a good idea. I hadn’t thought of that. I studied the man opposite. I was loathe to admit it but I had been finding him gopher jobs in the few months he’d been here. Apparently I’d caught his ability to turf out Alicent’s spies and completely missed the fact he had a mind for sneakiness I could use. If I made him ‘master of whispers’ I could hopefully get another window into Westeros that wasn’t being filtered through the various factions amongst the Blacks and Greens.<br />
<br />
I pulled a sheet of paper close. Technically, when writing a proclamation that someone has the authority to speak on your behalf it should be done on vellum, not paper. It was, surprise surprise, considered an insult but I judged Joffrey to be among the less block headed members of my staff.<br />
<br />
“I would have you become my spy master of sorts,” I said as I slid it across to him and he read it, eyes widening.<br />
<br />
“You grace! I…” he paused, mouth moving. It was more than a crippled second son had any right to expect. I saw the anger at the imagined pity.<br />
<br />
“Don’t mistake this for pity or kindness, Ser Joffrey. You are capable and have my complete trust but I have no doubt that you’ll be cursing my name in a years time. I’m tasking you with routing out my enemies spies as well as establishing spies of your own within their ranks,” I informed him, taking care that my voice was cooler than I actually felt.<br />
<br />
He swallowed audibly and nodded, staring at the paper transfixed. Having the ear of the heir to the throne was no minor thing.<br />
<br />
“I should begin immediately,” he said finally.<br />
<br />
“Speak to the castellan for an allocation of funds. Nothing too extravagant. Our goal is to ensure Dragonstone answers to me and only me currently,” The paper I’d given him should mean the cranky old man should listen to Joffrey. Oh well, he could come and find me if he was refused.<br />
<br />
“I will not let you down, you Grace,” he swore as he pushed himself to his feet with a bit of struggle. My smugness about something going my way lasted until well past dinner, when Laenor presented himself at the door to my rooms looking decidedly discontent.<br />
<br />
“You made Joffrey your voice on Dragonstone,” he accused the moment the doors shut and the room was free of unwelcome ears. “You made him your spymaster.”<br />
<br />
“Yes Laenor, I did. He has a mind for people and the Seven know he needs something to do.” I snapped back, good mood evaporating. My husband dropped onto the bed and rested his head in his hands before sighing.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry. I should not… I miss him. I miss him so much. It’s like I’m missing an arm,” he flopped backwards and stared at the ceiling, talking to himself more than me. “Maybe Qarl is right and I should let him stew through it on his own.”<br />
<br />
“Qarl?” I asked, voice weak. Laenor sat up, blushing slightly in the candlelight.<br />
<br />
“Yes. Ser Qarl Correy. He and I have been…” He paused as if looking for the right word. “…close recently.”<br />
<br />

								<div class="bbWrapper">Flying on the back of a dragon was indescribable. Nothing could compare to sitting astride a dragon as it soared through the air. Atop Syrax, I could understand why the Freehold had thought itself above gods and men. A light touch of the whip urged Syrax onward. She shuddered beneath me before pushing herself ahead of the bulkier Seasmoke. I let out a laugh of joy as I saw the chagrin on Laenor’s face as I moved to overtake.<br />
<br />
King’s Landing was beginning to peer over the horizon. We’d be there within ten or so minutes. The thought wasn’t quite enough to take the joy from me, nothing could whilst flying Syrax, but it was enough to temper it. To get my thoughts moving back into the mind set I would need to survive court.<br />
<br />
It had been a hectic morning. I’d awoken early to track down Joffrey. He hadn’t been keen on the idea of getting rid of Laenor’s current lover but brief rant about the Knight’s dubious claims of honour had seen the Stormlander clench his jaw and promise Qarl Correy would dealt with. Perhaps this was how my descent started because I was fairly sure that if Joffrey had him killed I wouldn’t care. In another life he was bought and paid for to end Laenor’s life. Better route him out now than risk a blade at our back later. Especially if he had been Daemon’s stooge.<br />
<br />
As we soared over the Keep both dragons let out a bellowing roar. We made for the Dragonpit and I was reminded of yet something else I would need to deal with when I ruled. The Dragonpit was bad for dragons raised in it. There seemed to be a point in a dragons development when the malign effects were lessened but it was easy to figure out which dragons had spent too much time in the pit in their younger years.<br />
<br />
Vermithor, Silverwing, Seasmoke, Vhagar - All were huge creatures for their ages and strong fliers to boot. In comparison, dragons such as Dreamfyre, my own Syrax and even Rhaenys’ Meleys were smaller and more slender. They lacked the sheer power non-pit dragons of similar ages. Of course, the pit dragons were easier to claim and train so perhaps that had been Maegor and Jaehaerys’ thoughts when they’d built the place.<br />
<br />
The pit dragons may be stunted to start with but they could be salvaged. Plenty of food and flying had seen my Syrax able to match Seasmoke in speed and she was, according to Rhaenys, one of the best living dragons when it came to aerobatics. Rhaenys’ Meleys was now bigger and stronger than Dreamfyre, a dragon older than her by a few decades simply due to being on Driftmark for just over two decades.<br />
<br />
I allowed Laenor to land first, circling the pit as keepers rushed forward to attend. Seasmoke snapped and growled as his harness was removed and a great loop of steel chain pulled about his neck. Laenor’s whip snapped a few times as he drove his dragon into the pit proper. It was quick and efficient. No one wanted to mess around where a dragon was concerned. They might suffer their riders but anyone else was fair game, either for roasting or a simple bite or swipe of the claws.<br />
<br />
With a pang of loss I took Syrax in for the landing. She knew the routine, having spent most of her early life here and needed much less guidance than Seasmoke had. Again, the keepers were quick and efficient and Syrax soon followed Seasmoke into the gloom with minimal prodding.<br />
<br />
I allowed myself a deep breath in the blazing sun of King’s Landing. Up here, on Rhaneys’ Hill, the stench of the city was well obscured by the smell of Dragon and that had long ceased to bother me. Around me, men scurried to separate our baggage from the harnesses. Being royalty had it’s upsides I supposed. Like never having to unpack your bags.<br />
<br />
I was pulled from my musing by a the approach of a tall knight dressed in the armour of the Dragon Keepers. They had supposedly sworn an oath to defend the Dragonpit and the dragons themselves from danger whilst they rested. They oversaw pit security and the dragon’s actual keepers, usually smallfolk drawn in by the promise of good coin and a payout if they died or were injured in their duties.<br />
<br />
From the sneer he couldn’t quite hide and the shallow bow that was just inside propriety I would guess he was one of Alicent’s appointments. No wonder the Dragonpit was left so undefended in canon if this was the quality of men we were letting in these days. No doubt the scent of war had these green knights charging forth, convinced that because they’d seen dragons docile under their riders, they could handle a dragon in battle.<br />
<br />
“Your Grace,” he began with obvious distaste. “I am Ser Byren Hastwyck, current Commander of the Pit. I welcome you to King’s Landing in the name of His Grace King Viserys the First. I have taken the liberty to arrange for a litter to take you to Keep.”<br />
<br />
Now there was a problem. If I took the litter I would be hidden from the smallfolk of King’s Landing. Given I didn’t know how I would be received by them the litter was probably safer. Then again the smallfolk reception would give me an accurate litmus test for the current attitudes in the capital. When in doubt, get a second opinion?<br />
<br />
“Lord Husband! Do you desire to ride through the city or take the litter?” I shouted, ignoring Ser Byren’s startled look. Laenor, clearly amused, abandoned his task of directing the stewards and made his way over. I hoped he caught on that this Knight was not friendly.<br />
<br />
“Riding if that’s possible, Rhaenyra, I can’t stand the litter,” he replied once he was in speaking range. If his answer displeased Alicent’s stooge, he didn’t show it. Instead he gave a stiff bow and promised that horses would be ready soon.<br />
<br />
I placed my hands on Laenor’s hips, ignoring the way he tensed slightly.<br />
<br />
“It seems Alicent’s rot extends to the Dragonpit,” I murmured. He eveidently caught on to my ploy as his arms wound around my back and he lowered his head so he could murmur in turn. His warm breath ghosting across my ear took me by surprise and I shuddered. If he realised why, he didn’t show it.<br />
<br />
“A strengthened Black faction can check her ambition, Rhaenyra. We just need to focus on building it up,” he assured me in a low voice.<br />
<br />
I curled into him, luxuriating in a warm, firm body before checking myself. By the Seven, could I at least keep it in my pants for five minutes? Yet when I pulled away it was with a reluctance I didn’t want to feel. Being seventeen again was a pain, all those hormones and no place to safely stick them. Laenor shot me a puzzled glance as Ser Byren made his way back to us.<br />
<br />
“Your horses are ready,” he stated with the air of someone who simply wished we could be gone as soon as possible. I had been away from the capital for too long if Alicent had managed to install enough of her supporters that this minor Knight felt comfortable dancing so close to outright hostility.<br />
<br />
I hesitate to say that the ride through the city was uneventful. It started off without much fanfare with some of the Kinghts of the Dragonpit forming around us but we were soon getting attention. Thankfully, the smallfolk of King’s Landing seemed remarkably ambivalent to me. I couldn’t pick out anything overly harsh but they also didn’t seem to have the love for me that Margaery Tyrell had inspired in canon. It was certainly something to look into cultivating at least, the smallfolk of King’s Landing had hated Rhaenyra so much they’d died by the thousands to slaughter the dragons within the Dragonpit. As we got closer to the Keep the crowds grew thicker and the noise louder, mostly from the various markets. I noted Gold Cloaks reacting, forming a barrier and shoving them back out of our way so that we weren’t held up in traffic.<br />
<br />
Eventually, with much smiling and waving, we made it to the Keep. We were shown into a set of rooms and given time to freshen ourselves up and change from the riding clothes to court clothes and then it was time to confront Viserys. Joy. Laenor was oddly quiet the entire time. As much as I wanted to ask him what was going on, we didn’t have time.<br />
<br />
The Throne room was as unchanged as always. The huge skulls of dragons past hung from the walls interspersed with tapestry's depicting Aenar the Wise, Daenys the Dreamer, Gaemon the Glorious and Aegon the Conqueror. It was full to the brim with nobles from all corners of the Seven Kingdoms with the exception of the Iron Islands and the North. Much to my annoyance, I noticed that the Reach seemed extremely overrepresented. When I reached the foot of the Throne I bowed low to it’s occupant whilst simultaneously trying to ignore the person sitting on the smaller throne next to him.<br />
<br />
“Daughter, it pleases me much that you have blessed us all here with your presence,” came Viserys’ voice. I stood up straight and shot him a polite smile. Next to him, Alicent glared daggers at me in the corner of my eye.<br />
<br />
He’d put on weight in the few months since I’d last seen him. Viserys had always been prone to overindulge in food and wine. When Prince Baelon had been alive, he’d dragged Viserys out every morning to spar. After he died and Viserys became heir, that exercise stopped and my royal father had begun piling on the pounds. Now it seemed he was indulging himself even more which didn’t bode well for him living a long and healthy life in which he somehow outlives Alicent.<br />
<br />
“I, and my Lord Husband, thank you for your welcome, Father,” I replied. At my words Laenor stepped forward and bowed again and Viserys’ smile grew even wider. Probably at the thought that heirs were only around the corner if we were finally getting on. I forged onward. “I have heard I have a new brother, Father, and have come here to pay respects.”<br />
<br />
That got the court murmuring and Alicent frowning. Daeron had not been presented to the court yet and likely wouldn’t for a month or so. Not until the Maester could be sure he was unlikely to fall prey to any of the common ailments baby’s were wont to get in Westeros. The fact that I had come early, seemingly eager to meet a male sibling, no doubt had them all wondering what I was up too. Viserys, on the other hand, merely beamed at my perceived love for a new brother.<br />
<br />
“Of course, daughter! I will arrange a private family meal and you can catch up with your other siblings as well.” Oh Viserys, you poor silly fool. This is not going to go how you want it too.<br />
<br />
As Laenor and I made a show of happily accepting I realised something. This is going to be another awkward family dinner again, isn’t it?</div>

								<div class="bbWrapper">After waiting around and chatting to the various nobles, touching base with a few of the present Blacks to boot, until it was socially appropriate to retreat, Laenor and I found ourselves in a suite of rooms. Our luggage had been brought up and unpacked for us, I was relieved to note. Ser Byren seemed the type to ‘lose’ it in transit.<br />
<br />
Now I felt a tiny shred of guilt for making a mention to Father that he didn’t seem to be enjoying his job at the Dragonpit due to the fine temper he had been in. Father’s annoyed look had told me he’d gotten my meaning and that Ser Hastwyck wouldn’t have his royal appointment much longer. Only a tiny one though. One that could easily be banished by remembering his sneer.<br />
<br />
Before we dressed, I collared a passing servant myself and had two messages sent out. One to the Guild of Alchemists to request a meeting at their soonest convenience and the other to Ser Harwin Strong and Larys Strong, inviting them to eat with us tomorrow night.<br />
<br />
No doubt Alicent would be more interested in my message to Harwin. At the moment, even Viserys occasionally contracted the Alchemist’s Guild so even if many might mutter about it, it would likely be written off as a product of my uncommon interest in alchemy. No one would invoke the w-word in relation to it at least. Harwin was a different story. Laenor would have to be there at all times, Larys too. If I got permission to search the tunnels I would have to convince the older brother to remain with Laenor and allow me to go alone or with just Larys. No one would believe I’d sleep with Larys, poor guy. It was an annoyance but if I had to play the political game I needed to stop handing my enemies ammunition.<br />
<br />
A few hours later, a steward stopped by to lead us to the private dining area used by the royal family as if I, the heir apparent, did not know where it was. I kept my smile gracious though. I could not afford rumours of a bad temper to go about. I gave word for a steward to follow us with the gifts I’d bought. When we arrived, Viserys and Alicent were there sans children but clutching a sniffling bundle of cloth Alicent that I assumed to be Daeron. Thankfully, the Kingsguard on duty was not the Lord Commander. I’d probably end up stabbing Criston if I had to deal with him today.<br />
<br />
Father enveloped me in a hug I wish I could let myself enjoy before moving on to Laenor. Hugs from the royal person were not something that happened everyday and the aftermath left Laenor looking dumbfounded. I was hard not to laugh as Viserys steered me over to the latest addition to the family. Daeron was a baby. Babies, for the most part, look exactly the same. Still, I made a show of cooing over him and even managed to coax a smile from him.<br />
<br />
I was interrupted from making a show of being a good big sister by a bundle of energy flinging itself into my legs. This one I gave a genuine smile to as Helaena beamed up at me.<br />
<br />
“Hello little one!” I exclaimed as I lifted her up. She immediately curled into me for a hug I gladly returned. In the corner of my eye, Viserys smile widened and Alicent looked as if someone had just served her curdled milk.<br />
<br />
“Did you bring presents?” she asked, eye wide.<br />
<br />
“Of course!” I smiled and let her down. As I did I caught sight of Aegon and Aemond.<br />
<br />
I’d tried. I really had. I’d played the doting big sister, read them stories and made time for them. It had seemed like it was working for a while. Then I’d noticed him drawing back, shying away. When Alicent had suggested betrothing me to Aegon, the boy had exploded into a fury before storming away which had nixed that idea. I’d tried to coax the reason for his outburst from him but what I’d got was a whole lot of garbled, snot covered whining that sounded as if it could be ripped straight from Alicent’s mouth.<br />
<br />
I’d gathered she’d spent every moment I wasn’t with Aegon telling him I was stealing his birthright, intending on killing him or worse. A whole lot of me was furious. Alicent had terrified the poor boy and in doing so had laid the first slab on the path to the Dance. On the other hand, the Rhaenyra in me was angry that her overtures of love had been denied and wanted to slap the sulky little brat for being rude.<br />
<br />
It was had to separate that out.<br />
<br />
Helaena had been a pleasant success. Evidently, Alicent hadn’t found the need to fill her daughter’s head with visions of me literally eating babies and by the time she’d realised a need too nothing short of watching me murder kittens was going to convince Helaena I was anything other than the greatest older sister to ever exist. In response, she’d kept Aemond from me as much as she could get away with. So now I had two sulky little brothers and a bundle of energy and affection for a sister.<br />
<br />
And now Daeron. Was it too much to hope she was lured into a false sense of security by me relocating to Dragonstone? Given the way she was clutching him to her chest, I’d say not.<br />
<br />
“Aegon, look at you! You’ve grown so much,” I said with all the false pride of an older sister. He straightened under my scrutiny and shot me a practised smile that I was impressed to see only looked slightly strained. Aemond gave me a baleful look as I turned to him. Mother above, what had Alicent been telling him that a four year old would have that expression.<br />
<br />
“Have you started squiring yet?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“He has, under Ser Criston Cole,” Alicent said from somewhere behind me. There was a note of maliciousness to her voice. Her acquisition of Cole was one of her greatest victories and she enjoyed shoving it in my face at every conceivable moment.<br />
<br />
“Has Ser Criston forbidden him to speak?” I asked her archly, my temper coming to the fore for a moment.<br />
<br />
“Rhaenyra!” barked Viserys, warning in his tone. Beside him, Laenor looked like he’d rather be informing The Cannibal that he was, in fact, a very delicious baby dragon and Alicent looked triumphant. Aemond laid a hand on his brother’s arm, looking ready to leap at me and start biting.<br />
<br />
“I apologise. That was ill-done of me,” I answered, forcing the anger down. It would not do to pull a Daemon and try to punch a seven-year old child. A traumatised seven-ear old child who was terrified enough, I reminded myself.<br />
<br />
“You shouldn’t apologise, Aegon was being rude,” came Helaena’s pouted response.<br />
<br />
“No, he wasn’t!” Aemond all but screeched and Helaena glared at him with such ferocity I suddenly wanted to laugh.<br />
<br />
“No, Helaena is right. I was being rude. I apologise, Sister.”<br />
<br />
Oh, that was bad. Aegon had finally found his voice and I could see Ser Criston’s polished and precise manner in it. Aemond shot me a look of pure venom even as Aegon struggled to keep his polite smile up even as he shook in fear. It was hard to be angry with him when he looked like he was about to faint. I clapped my hands together and gestured the forgotten gifts forward.<br />
<br />
Aegon looked as if his soul was about to leave his body when he saw the dagger. I made sure to give it too him hilt first, it may have a fancy sheath but given the way the boy was eyeing it anyone would think I was seconds away from stabbing him with it. His bow was polite enough and I was somewhat amused to see that his first instinct was to unsheathe it and poke it to see if it was sharp. It was and he made his finger bleed. He didn’t tahnk me but I let it go because Alicent was making such a fuss you’d think he’d just cut his thumb off.<br />
<br />
After that, I presented Helaena with her thread. She was fond of sewing and she was good at it too. She thanked me happily and her bow was sloppy but genuine. Aemond took his gifts with a pout and a bow so shallow that had it come from anyone else would have been breathtakingly rude. Still he was four and convinced I was going to murder him and his siblings at some point so I overlooked it.<br />
<br />
Daeron wasn’t old enough to do anything more than gurgle and wiggle so Alicent thanked me for his gifts with such an icy tone that I came close to calling her on it. Our impromptu staring match was interrupted by Viserys clapping his hands together loudly.<br />
<br />
“Perhaps we should all sit down,” he said after Alicent and I recovered from our simultaneous heart attacks.<br />
<br />
Laenor seized the King’s interruption like a drowning man spotting dry land and all but threw himself into his seat. I took a seat at his side at a much more sedate pace after favouring Helaena with a smile and wink. Helaena took the chair to my other side and stuck her tongue out at Aemond when Viserys and Alicent weren’t looking. Daeron was handed off to his nursemaids and whisked away as the food was laid out.<br />
<br />
“I have heard you’ve been busy on Driftmark, Ser Laenor,” said Alicent after a period of silence as we dug in. Laenor gave a her a smile and nodded.<br />
<br />
“Father had me overseeing the ongoing construction at High Tide and working to ensure Spicetown’s growth is well managed,” he replied. “But he’s made other arrangements after speaking with Rhaenyra,”<br />
<br />
Before Alicent could spring whatever nasty remark she’d been setting up, Viserys interrupted.<br />
<br />
“Speaking with? He has been on Dragonstone?” The question was directed at me more than Laenor.<br />
<br />
“Yes, Lord Corlys travelled back recently. Although he’ll be leaving again soon for the Stepstones once more.” I said, leaving out the fact that he’d only come back to yell at Laenor for not producing an heir fast enough and his reduction of Laenor’s duties being directly related to that.<br />
<br />
“Is there any news of Daemon?” asked Viserys and I briefly had a vision of him wearing my soup bowl. Judging from the brief look of utter distaste that flashed across Alicent’s face, we were still united in our feelings on Daemon. As Laenor explained to situation on the islands, I allowed myself to tune out, whilst massaging my suddenly aching fingers.<br />
<br />
Then again, Daemon was usually the only topic that we did agree on. The rumours about their supposed affair were true and had been the basis for Otto’s complete and utter loathing of the man. Daemon’s antics had also been the basis for the rift in the friendship I had been cultivating with Alicent given that she perceived him abandoning her to shower me with attention. That I very much didn’t want it hadn’t meant much to her.<br />
<br />
Still, whaling on Daemon (or his reputation when he wasn’t present) was a good wholesome activity both the Blacks and the Greens used as a point of unity. I thought it was nice that we could all put aside our differences every now and again but Viserys apparently didn’t see it that way. Even when Daemon had… Even when I had told him about Daemon he hadn’t cared to listen.<br />
<br />
Instead, he’d scolded me for turning against family. Told me my grandfather would be ashamed to see me using court politics to so shame my own Uncle. I suppressed the old rage. I knew Viserys was wrong, Prince Baelon would have cracked both their heads together had he been informed about Daemon’s behaviour. It was in Viserys’ nature though to seek the easy path, to ignore problems and allow them escalate until they exploded in his face.<br />
<br />
My fingers were proof enough.<br />
<br />
The Dance of Dragons was proof enough.<br />
<br />
I tuned back in to discover Laenor and Viserys discussing what could be done about the Dornish potentially allying with the Triarchy. As much as I didn’t wish to do anything that would help Daemon, I figured it wouldn’t hurt to score some brownie points with Viserys for at least trying.<br />
<br />
“The Dornish follow the Seven, do they not?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm, yes. It’s belief is stronger to the west but those on the coast do follow it,” he replied, stroking his moustache. I hated that stupid moustache so much.<br />
<br />
“Perhaps we can send some singers into the western part of Dorne to sing about the evils of slavery,” I suggested.<br />
<br />
“It couldn’t hurt and at best it could cause a rift in Dornish unity. I will put the idea to the Master of Whispers.” Oh good. It’ll never get done then. Honestly, Viserys why did you even appoint Jaremy Corbray. He thinks any kind of sneaking around is beneath anyone with ‘honour’ and certainly beneath a Knight like himself.<br />
<br />
Oh who am I kidding? Incompetence is entirely in character for you.</div>

								<div class="bbWrapper">Painfully awkward dinner finally over with, Laenor and I slunk back to our rooms. Awaiting us were two notices in reply to my earlier messages. One from the Alchemists Guild inviting us to tour their building tomorrow and discuss whatever business I had with one of their Wisdoms. The second was from the Strong brothers accepting our invitation to dinner.<br />
<br />
Laenor opted to stick to his own rooms that night. It was all well and good for him to sleep in my bed some of the time but too much was considered unseemly which I honestly considered an odd double standard. Sleep didn’t come easy and found myself awake as dawn broke over King’s Landing feeling as if I hadn’t slept at all.<br />
<br />
The maids, likely Alicent’s creatures as my own had not yet arrived, clucked over my dark, sunken eyes and brought out a range of cosmetics I was forced to sharply order to be put away as I was fairly certain it was full of fun and exciting poisons that I wasn’t keen to rub into my face.<br />
<br />
Instead I settled for a quick, relatively speaking anyway, bath and several cups of Mint Tea to pull my mind into the present and out of the longing to go back bed. I still didn’t look my best when Laenor presented himself at my door but I couldn’t afford to put off a visit to the Guild. Not if they could help me get the Black Powder working.<br />
<br />
I opted for a litter instead of riding through the city. I was too tense to smile and make it look convincing and too tired to play the beautiful flawless princess of the people. Laenor sulked about it as it turns out he genuinely didn’t like the litter but he took pity when faced with an expression that I had hoped conveyed the possibility of impending wrath but according to him made me look like I was about to cry.<br />
<br />
The city was awake around us. I heard pedlars and stall owners hawking their goods, two men arguing about a broken cartwheel, a gold cloak hauling a thief off to the barracks and more as I dozed the entire way to the Guild. Laenor left me alone, which was something I was grateful for.<br />
<br />
The Wisdom that greeted us was a tall man with dark hair turning grey. His bow was deep and respectful and seemed genuine. When he straightened up, he had a smile on his face that had his eyes twinkling.<br />
<br />
“Your Graces, can I start by saying how honoured we are that you are visiting today,” he began. “I am Wisdom Jerrett,”<br />
<br />
“I’m honoured to be invited to visit, Wisdom, I’ve heard much about the Guild,” I replied. Keep back the main flattery for later if they got stingy with secrets. Laenor echoed my sentiments but seemed happy for me to take the lead, so I did.<br />
<br />
Jerrett gestured us to follow. I allowed him to show off the buildings and the labs. They were impressive for a medieval guild. He seemed especially proud of the custom-made glass implements they imported from Myr, expanding on their uses. I managed to understand every third word but I think the gist was that they were used in distillation, something that surprised me. From what I’d seen, the idea of distillation didn’t seem to well known in Westeros at large.<br />
<br />
I made sure Laenor and I made all the appropriate noises of awe and shock and Wisdom Jerrett only swelled further with pride. Here was a man who lived and breathed Alchemy and the Guild. Any compliment for them was compliment to him. I dread to think how he would have reacted had I accidentally insulted them.<br />
<br />
It was a very happy Wisdom that led us into a bright and airy office and seated himself behind the desk as we placed ourselves in front of it.<br />
<br />
“Truly well worth the visit, do you not think, Rhaenyra?” Laenor began. The Wisdom puffed up even more.<br />
<br />
“Oh indeed. Forgive me , however, I did not come entirely for the tour,” I made sure to inject a note of apology into my tone. I did not want the Wisdom to suspect he was being used. I needn’t have bothered. Jerrett leant forward in his chair, looking fascinated.<br />
<br />
“We had heard rumours of Her Grace’s interest in Alchemy. They were not wrong?” He sounded thrilled at the thought of a royal alchemist.<br />
<br />
“I fear I do not understand most principals of Alchemy but I had been attempting to recreate a recipe I found in an old book. I confess, I have only found failure,” I ‘admitted’. Jerrett looked thoughtful before pulling a battered and already scrawled on piece of paper towards him.<br />
<br />
“Could you describe the recipe? And the book?” he asked, preparing a quill and ink. I relayed the main points of Black Powder to him. After jotting it down he summoned an apprentice and ordered the young-looking boy to see if the Guild had anything similar in their records.<br />
<br />
“The book itself… I remember it didn’t make a a lot of sense, it was in poor condition to start with. The language was confused and imprecise, I suspect now of course, that it was a poor translation of an earlier work. I think it was Valyrian in origin. I know now that it was likely worth it weight in gold but as a child it was merely an interesting prop to practise my hand with.”<br />
<br />
The Wisdom nodded along with my explanation, face solemn.<br />
<br />
“A sad but common tale. Have you given thought that it may have been fake? Some sort of joke?” It wasn’t and I knew it wasn’t but I could hardly tell him why. I shrugged in response and he stroked his chin before shrugging himself.<br />
<br />
“No doubt, Your Grace, we shall discover the truth when young Harald returns from his search. If it is legitimate however, I would be very interested to see it,” his tone was light but a book on ancient tech probably had him drooling internally.<br />
<br />
I had an idea.<br />
<br />
My understanding of the tech I’d written down had been shaky at best, mostly half remembered from a satirical book on rebuilding the world if you got stuck in the past somehow. I wouldn’t have the time to interpret that half understanding of my younger self into real world tech if I was going to be getting political and I certainly couldn’t trust Maesters to help.<br />
<br />
“Of course, Wisdom Jerrett. It may be selfish but I had hoping to use anything newly discovered to improve Dragonstone.” The Wisdom got my hint immediately. He nodded.<br />
<br />
“Should it turn out to be worth looking into, perhaps we could discuss setting up a small campus there. You would have the finest minds of the Alchemist’s Guild on hand to sort the wheat from the chaff.”<br />
<br />
Got you.<br />
<br />
I was feeling indulgent enough not to point out that being involved in my pseudo-tech uplift from the beginning would massively boost their prestige in relation to the Maesters.<br />
<br />
It took ‘young Harald’ another half and hour to appear with an old leather bound book. Jerrett immediately flipped it open, sending a cloud of dust into the air that had me sneezing and Laenor coughing.<br />
<br />
“Apologies, apologies, Your Graces. A hazard one gets used to when working with old tomes. Now, lets see… Powders, powders… hmmmmmm, how interesting.” After that he was silent for a few moments but I could see his grey eyes flickering back and forth across the page. Finally, he shut it and handed the tome back to Harald.<br />
<br />
“Take this back to the archives and have a room set up with a supply of Niter, Vitriol and Charcoal,” he barked. Harald all but de-materialised from the room. Jerrett then smiled at us.<br />
<br />
“It seems this book may well be the real thing. The Black Powder you have described is known to us. Although I suspect it is not Valyrian in origin but somewhere further East,” he explained.<br />
<br />
I was forced to bite the inside of my cheek to keep from grinning. So it was me, I had gotten the recipe wrong. My dream of shooting Otto in his stupid knees could still come true!<br />
<br />
“The East? Like Yi-Ti?” Laenor asked, barely constrained excitement. Of all of the Sea Snakes legendary journeys it seemed that Yi-Ti excited Laenor the most, I would have to remember that. The Wisdom was nodding.<br />
<br />
“Indeed. I have often said that at it’s heart, Alchemy is the scientific study of magic. In the West, this method has only been in use for a few hundred years. We are too eager to rely on superstition and belief or even out right denial. The East are far more enlightened than us in this regard. They understand the need to study magic and have since before the fall of the Great Empire of the Dawn.” He sounded like he was lecturing but not even my internal glee at the thought of Black Powder could distract me from that name drop.<br />
<br />
“The Great Empire of the Dawn. I thought it a myth?” The Wisdom shook his head so hard I was worried he was going to make himself dizzy.<br />
<br />
“Not at all. We have a lot of evidence that it very much existed although perhaps not ruled by God Kings.” We all gave an indulgent chuckle at that.<br />
<br />
“What is this evidence? How does it relate to Alchemy?” asked Laenor. Talk of the East had definitely made this visit way more interesting for him.<br />
<br />
Oh Gods, Laenor was medieval weeaboo.<br />
<br />
“Oh, there’s the obvious evidence such as the Five Forts and other such buildings dotted about Essos but if we’re talking Alchemy then nothing is more proof than the Tablet of Stars.” He said it with such reverence that both I and Laenor found ourselves leaning forward.<br />
<br />
“Found in Asshai, few Westerosi scholars have ever managed to get close enough to describe it. They say it speaks of the Great Empire’s fall into anarchy and the first Long Night.”<br />
<br />
Oh. Oh no. Oh god no. No white walkers please.<br />
<br />
My face must have reflected my horror because he chuckled and leant back.<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t worry, Your Grace. Many civilisations from that time have records of the Long Night. It’s been accepted by scholars all over Westeros and Essos that this was some sort of super winter. Keeping an Empire together in those circumstances would have been next to impossible. Why, what records we have from the North in that same time period says that even a much smaller kingdom shattered into independent tribes.”<br />
<br />
Why did today keep going from bad to good to bad? I was interrupted from my brooding and Laenor’s total fan-boying over Yi-ti by Harald’s reappearance to let us know the room Jerrett had requested had been prepared.<br />
<br />
We dutifully followed him through the halls to another surprisingly well lit room. Laid out were three jars of powder I recognised, a mortar and pestle, measuring implements, a candle, wooden splints and for some reason a knife.<br />
<br />
We watched in silence as Jerrett pulled on a pair of gloves and began grinding the three ingredients into a fine powder. He measured out a mixture that looked roughly like my own before mixing to Black Powder itself. Finally he took a small pinch of the finished powder a placed it on a ceramic tile.<br />
<br />
“It does look like yours,” Laenor hazarded after a moment.<br />
<br />
“Eastern books refer to this as Burn Powder. When properly prepared, it will burn and explode readily,” explained Jerrett, lighting a wooden splint. Then, as we watched, he placed it against the powder. Nothing happened.<br />
<br />
“I see your look of confusion. This powder is not the finished product. You likely stopped here thinking it finished but there is one more step.” He pulled of his glove and picked up the knife. Then whilst holding his hand over the small deposit of powder he pricked his finger and bled on it. Using the knife he ensured the blood was soaked in before retrieving another splint.<br />
<br />
This time, when he pressed the splint to it, it burst into flame.<br />
<br />
I stared in horror, not bothering to smother it in a mask of politeness.<br />
<br />
“I understand your horror, Your Grace. We try not to use blood in our practises here. I take it the original manual did not go into detail about this part.”<br />
<br />
I shook my head. I had no words. Beside me, Laenor looked similarly pale. Looking sympathetic, Jerrett steered us back to his office, leaving Harald to clean up.</div>

								<div class="bbWrapper">It had been Laenor who’d had the sense to arrange a further meeting about setting up a satellite campus on Dragonstone and access to the ‘book’. I’d been too busy trying to set my feelings in order. In order to create Black Powder in sufficient quantities I would need to wade through a literal river of blood. I would burn through any reputation I developed. It would be worse than original Rhaenyra, worse than Maegor even.<br />
<br />
I blinked in the afternoon light as Laenor steered me into the litter. I felt numb. What kind of bullshit logic did this place operate on? All this talk about ancient tablets, the Long Night and blood magic was taking a second seat to the fact that even when the first round of testing had not worked I’d still assumed I’d get the Black Powder somehow. That I’d still have guns and that all the politics could be avoided with a superior show of firepower.<br />
<br />
When the litter stopped we were not at the Red Keep but the Dragonpit. At my questioning look, Laenor smiled and placed a warm hand over my cool one.<br />
<br />
“You looked upset. I figured we could make a start on that promise to fly together,” he said, with a reassuring smile.<br />
<br />
“Thank you. And… Thank you for sorting things out with Wisdom Jerrett.” I had to fight a wince at my tone. I sounded exhausted. I felt exhausted. I wanted nothing more than to fly to Dragonstone, curl up in my bed and weep at how unfair it all was. He held me close for a few moments and I tried not to care about that jolt of wrongness.<br />
<br />
The flight on Syrax cheered me up. The feeling of freedom that being a Princess tended to strangle. I raced Laenor several times and won most of them. I watched as Syrax skimmed over the bay, skimming her claws through the water. After a while, our flight descended into playing the dragons version of Tag! in which we took it in turns to see if we could deliver gentle nips to the other's tail.<br />
<br />
As Seasmoke and Syrax danced over the waves we caught sight of the vast bulk of Vhagar flying alongside two ships. One bore a Velaryon banner and the other Targaryen one. Together, Laenor and I moved in, circling Vhagar. She was not a fast beast and our playful flitting back forth certainly got a rise out of her rider if the yelling was any indication.<br />
<br />
I felt better by the time we had all landed and the dragons moved into Dragonpit. Less like the world had ended but I still felt fragile, as if any little thing could shatter me. I couldn’t afford to shatter in King’s Landing. I happily sank into Laena’s hug before moving away and laughing as Laenor ruffled his sister’s immaculate ringlets and she slapped at his hands in mock annoyance.<br />
<br />
“So, I hear you were on the wrong end of Father recently,” Laena mentioned as we clambered into the litter. Laenor groaned and Laena laughed. She was in an odd position when it came to her father. She was the second half of his grand plan to cement his legacy. Beautiful, wealthy and equipped with a dragon, Corlys had sought marry his daughter to my father, the King, because aim high I guess. When he failed, he’d used her to secure Braavos’ support in his upcoming conquest.<br />
<br />
A marriage to the then Sea Lord’s son with the understanding he would have the prestige of a dragon rider for a wife, the Sea Snake’s incredible wealth and the subtle pressure of his wife’s family controlling shipping in the narrow sea via the Stepstones backing him to succeed his father when he died. But the Sea Lord of Braavos’ died early and Tycheo Hartios had proved an utter wastrel. He’d quickly squandered his father’s money after his death by making several appallingly bad investments. Investments that had actually managed to damage his family name by sheer association. Apparently the Braavosi nobles saw lack of financial acumen as major turn off much as one dishonourable family member could tank a Westerosi House for generations, I supposed. By the time Laena was eligible to marry he’d been a penniless scion of a declining house.<br />
<br />
Corlys’ pride would not allow him to marry his daughter to such a man but a lot of the upfront money for the Conquest had been Hartios money. The Iron Bank themselves were involved when the contract was written and the contract stated she was to marry him. So Corlys came up with excuse after excuse as to why the wedding couldn’t happen yet whilst plying Tycheo with wine and women in the hope the fool would get himself killed.<br />
<br />
No wonder he’d jumped on Daemon marrying Laena in the original timeline, in fact, I’d take a bet that Corlys had asked Daemon to rid him of the stupid boy in the process. Just mentioning his name would have Corlys grinding his teeth, a fact I can assure you I did not take advantage of.<br />
<br />
The odd intersection of the deadlock on the marriage front, the massive dragon and Laena’s own personality meant her father was completely unsure of how to deal with her and so solved his problem by not dealing with her at all. As far as I could tell, as long as he was unable to incorporate her into his ongoing plans to strengthen House Velaryon, he liked to pretend she didn’t exist.<br />
<br />
“Rhaenyra dared have an original idea,” said Laenor dryly, sending Laena into peels of laughter. “He took it as well as expected.”<br />
<br />
That just made Laena laugh harder.<br />
<br />
“He blundered though. Now I know he has men on Dragonstone I intend to send them back to him via Driftmark,” I said lightly. Laenor frowned, likely realising that I was referring to Joffrey. No doubt he was worrying about the Knight being in danger. Corlys was basically a more restrained Tywin, I’d come to realise. He would not strike at me for the insult but Joffrey had no such protection.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I would pay to see Father’s face when he gets that note from Mother. Probably along with her commentary as well. ‘Damn you, you thick-headed fool!’”<br />
<br />
Laena’s excellent impression of her mother had me chuckling as well as Laenor guffawing. The ride back was spent with the two siblings making increasingly more ridiculous impressions of their parents. The horror of my earlier discovery seemed so far away but before I could let myself make plans for the future, I had to live through a meal with Harwin and Larys.<br />
<br />
Before that, we had to show our faces at court. Viserys greeted Laena warmly and Laenor and I chatted with Lord Hayford and one of the Rosbys. Both Houses were Blacks through and through but it was always a good idea to reinforce that loyalty. In addition, Laenor had managed to arrange a sit down meeting with Lord Wendwater through his nephew by discussing timber shipments. Today would not be a total loss then.<br />
<br />
Lord Wendwater was a hesitant Green. Given the complete lack of knowledge about where the young, impetuous Boros Baratheon would jump, he was right to be hesitant. The Stormlands bordered Lord Wendwater’s lands and would make a juicy target should the Stormlands declare for a different claimant. I had been hoping to start on the other side of the Crownlands in Cracklaw Point but those Lords rarely came to court. I spent the rest of the session tracking down and persuading the Black leaning Lord Celtigar to help me with the matter.<br />
<br />
Laena left us late on so that we could prepare to meet the Strong’s. Laenor thought it important we coordinated in order to subtly reinforce the fact Harwin had no chance with me, just in case he was still harbouring any mistaken thoughts. Which meant I got to try on a whole bunch of dresses, much to my internal glee. The current court style was heavily influenced by the Reach, not one I could imitate for obvious reasons, so finding a fashionable solution to that dilemma was always fun.<br />
<br />
I had adopted a Vale influenced wardrobe, for the most part. The long swishy dresses that accentuated the figure usually accompanied by an equally swishy mantle that could be made to evoke wings, useful for falcons and dragons. Whereas most of the Vale dresses were woollen, I favoured much richer fabrics. I did not need the dresses to last, nor did I need them to keep me warm. I opted for black and teal colour scheme, evoking mine and Laenor’s House’s.<br />
<br />
Laenor had little interest in fashion, like most Westerosi lords he liked to be seen as above it, but he trusted me when it came to saying it with clothes and figuring out what others were saying with their style of dress so I didn’t have to swat the back of his head too much as I ordered the servants to lay out his outfit.<br />
<br />
It had been a good idea to start preparing early as it turned out, we’d barely gotten ourselves dressed when Larys and Harwin arrived.<br />
<br />
Harwin was a gorgeous man. Tall, muscled and with a face that could melt any maiden’s heart and bearing that distinctive nose that would be as good as a smoking gun if I gave into the temptation, it really was not hard to see why Rhaenyra had risked everything to be with him. Larys, on the other hand, was everything his brother was not. He walked with a limp due to his twisted foot, his face could charitably be described as interesting when he smiled which was not a regular occurrence and he had peculiar, intense way of looking at you that gave you the impression he was trying to imagine you without clothes on.<br />
<br />
Given a choice, I’d take a talk with Larys over Harwin any day. He was breathtakingly intelligent and whilst shy, when he did speak it was always worth paying attention to him. Harwin on the other hand was quite willing to blather out every single thought that entered his fool head and I can assure you, very little of his thoughts were worth they energy it took to have them.<br />
<br />
As much as Larys was the complete opposite of a Westerosi lord, Harwin was the epitome of one.<br />
<br />
“Sorry we’re early, Your Grace. It’s difficult to time things with limpy here.” The shove that accompanied the comment nearly sent Larys sprawling but the smaller man recovered. Larys’ face did not move from it’s usual scowl but his eyes were full of hate. If Harwin wasn’t even making the effort to reign in his usual Westerosi dickishness tonight was not going to be fun.<br />
<br />
“It’s not a problem, Ser Strong. Larys is a friend and I’m always willing to make accommodations for my friends.” I aimed a bright smile at the clubfoot but failed to coax one in return. I took his arm and guided him to the table, sitting him next to me if only to serve as a barrier against Harwin’s ongoing inane chatter.<br />
<br />
If the start of the meal was awkward it only became more so as time went on. Harwin alternated between taking cheap shots at his brother, shamelessly flirting with me, drinking enough wine to kill a horse and implying that Laenor was gay or possibly a woman in disguise. Some of his insults were a bit indistinct. Larys kept quiet, only speaking to correct his brother’s more outrageous claims and to ask how Ser Joffrey had recovered from the accident at my wedding tourney. He seemed happy to learn that Joffrey was up and about, finding ways to make himself useful. Both I and Laenor were wondering when Larys had even befriended Joffrey, I resolved to ask him about it next time I saw him.<br />
<br />
Finally, as we finished up dessert, I broached the topic I had invited them for.<br />
<br />
“I must admit I had an alternative motive for inviting you tonight,” I said, as the servants cleared the table. Harwin perked up like a dog at the sound of the treat packet being opened but Larys merely nodded as if he’d completely expected this.<br />
<br />
“Do you require our support in some kind scheme?” asked Harwin, eagerly. I forced myself not to grimace. If I ever wanted to sheme, it’d be Larys I’d choose. How Harwin had not given the game away himself in the original timeline was probably considered a minor miracle by some religions.<br />
<br />
“No, nothing like that, Ser Strong.” Laenor butted in, hastily. “You are aware of course that until she was four my lady wife lived in the Tower of the Hand?” Harwin look puzzled as if that had never occurred to him before but Larys merely nodded for him to continue.<br />
<br />
“As a child I was fond of exploring the tunnels in the Tower. I fear they are littered with old possessions of mine. I was wondering if you would allow me access so that I could reclaim them.”<br />
<br />
“Tunnels? I was unaware of this,” Larys responded before Harwin could even open his mouth.<br />
<br />
“Regardless, I’d be happy to accompany to accompany you,” Harwin quickly said, cutting off anything else his brother could say. It was what I had expected but luckily Laenor had come up with several excuses to lure the older Strong brother into staying with him. Harwin had little argument and was forced to sit there like a big, dumb puppy that knew it had done something wrong but couldn’t quite figure out what as Larys limped his way out the door as I followed.</div>

								<div class="bbWrapper">The Tower of the Hand was much changed since it had been Prince Baelon’s place of residence. Unsurprising, I suppose as it had seen two hands since. I only realised I stopped in the entrance way when Larys limped up behind me.<br />
<br />
“Is everything well, Your Grace?” he asked quietly, interrupting my mind as it began recreating the Tower as it had been when I’d first awoken as Rhaenyra.<br />
<br />
“Apologies, Larys. It has changed so much.” He nodded but didn’t elaborate further. We made our way inside. Lyonel’s household didn’t seem to be in a rush to bother us but I’d bet they’d be eager to report my presence in the tower to their master the moment they could.<br />
<br />
I didn’t bother making a show about remembering the entrance location. If it had been Harwin it would have worked but behaving like a ditzy woman around Larys was pointless. He’d just see through it and even if he didn’t, he wasn’t given to the pandering most men were all to willing to engage in around me.<br />
<br />
The tunnels were as dusty and gloomy as I remembered. My little collection had been stored in an alcove further in and I was proud that it only took one or two wrong turns before I located the stash. Larys’ head seemed to be on a swivel, his eyes wide as he took in the surprisingly extensive tunnel system. All I can say is Maegor definitely didn’t trust his Hands. There wasn’t a single room in the Tower you couldn’t eavesdrop on from the tunnels.<br />
<br />
The book was there, covered in grime and dust but other than that it looked undamaged. Well, book was an exaggeration really, it was a loose collection of paper I was telling everyone was copied from a book. It was the other items of the stash that took me completely of guard though. Gently, as if it might collapse at the touch, I lifted up the blue fabric of the blanket. As I realised just what it was, emotion I wasn’t prepared for punched me in the gut.<br />
<br />
I suppose this was just going to be one of those days and so I resigned myself to the storm of regret.<br />
<br />
“I had forgotten this was here. I thought it lost,” I choked and then realised I was crying. Behind me, Larys shifted uncomfortably. I turned the blanket over, obscured by dust but right where I remembered, the silver falcon and moon of the Arryn’s.<br />
<br />
Oh, I had not wanted to love Aemma Arryn. The Rhaenyra in me had forced me to but I hadn’t wanted to. The day she’d announced her pregnancy had been awful, I’d wept so much because I’d known. Aemma had assured me that a new child would not make her love me any less and I couldn’t… I couldn’t tell her what was coming. She’d ben desperate for a boy. Runciter had given the okay to get pregnant again but she’d died. Died because Viserys had married her when she’d been eleven and by thirteen she’d already given birth. A brother that had died before his first name day. It had ruined her health, ruined her body.<br />
<br />
Viserys should have known. Runciter should have known. They still kept pushing, for them a male heir was more important than a living wife. I’d come along and the effort alone had nearly killed her. She’d been fifteen and bed bound for months afterwards. Viserys hadn’t given up. He’d kept pushing and only miscarriages had followed. Until the babe she carried hadn’t died in the womb like the rest. Until the birth killed her. What had Viserys been thinking!?<br />
<br />
I knew the answer to that. He hadn’t. Stupid, stupid bastard!<br />
<br />
Seven month’s wasn’t enough to say goodbye to your Mother!<br />
<br />
Larys was awkwardly patting me on the back and I realised I was sobbing. I must have been doing it for some time if Larys had been moved enough to try his own brand of comforting. I dashed the tears from my eyes and gathered everything for the pages to a cracked pitcher.<br />
<br />
“My apologies, Larys. Old memories.” I hated how thick my voice sounded.<br />
<br />
“I quite understand. My own mother died in the child bed.” His voice was quiet. “Do you fear it?”<br />
<br />
The question took me by surprise. It was considered a woman’s duty to marry and birth heirs above anything else. To ask a woman if she feared the child bed was like asking a man if he feared battle. Fighting words to the Westerosi.<br />
<br />
Oh but I did fear child birth. Men would not understand and the only older female figure in my life was Alicent. I feared the child bed so badly that when I thought of it, in the dead of night, I was in danger of sending myself into spirals of panic. Breath coming short, head spinning - all for nothing because no matter how I twisted and turned I simply could not get away with not having children.<br />
<br />
“I would be a fool not too. Both my grandmothers died in childbirth, my mother died in childbirth.” My voice was wavering at the thought of it. “But I will do my duty when the time comes as they did before me.”<br />
<br />
“I have no doubt you will, Your Grace. If I may offer some advice though? Most Maester’s do not study childbirth overly much. Make sure yours is prepared.”<br />
<br />
I didn’t have time to delve into that comment because we emerged from the hatch to find Lord Strong and Viserys waiting for us. It wasn’t the two most powerful in the Seven Kingdoms that set my stomach rolling though, it was the man that flanked them. Ser Criston Cole. I suppose I couldn’t avoid him forever, he was still the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.<br />
<br />
Someone up there really hates me though. This hasn’t been the worst day I’ve had in Westeros but by Gods, it’s definitely in the running.<br />
<br />
Lord Strong studied me for a moment and then barked out an order for something clean myself with. I was ditched, covered in grime and dust with clear tear tracks on my face. I must have looked a state.<br />
<br />
“You went into the tunnels unguarded,” said the King. I examined him, trying to get an idea of which mood he was in tonight. He wasn’t angry, not truly, he seemed more annoyed. Unfortunately for him, I’d been reminded of his shortcomings recently so I was definitely not going to roll over and accept being reprimanded by him for something he had no right to stick his nose into.<br />
<br />
“It was hardly a risk. None of the tunnels lead outside the Keep and it was important,” I sneered back. I shouldn’t provoke him but I was tired. Today had been far too much and my emotions had been stretched to the breaking point. He scowled at me before focusing on the bundle I held.<br />
<br />
“It’s the blanket Mother gave me,” I answered before he could query it. At my answer, the irritation left him and instead he smiled indulgently.<br />
<br />
“Ah. It makes more sense now. You want it for your own babe?” he said as a maid bustled in with the water. I hadn’t even remembered it was there but now that I thought about it, it was a nice idea. I nodded as I used the water to clean myself up.<br />
<br />
“Well, I can’t argue with that. Does this mean you are pregnant?” Ser Criston stiffened at his words. Oh great, don’t ask how I’m doing ruling Dragonstone or whether I have opinions on roads. Those things aren’t important to being Queen, it’s all about how many babies you can shoot out and whether they have the correct hair colour. I will be Queen, not Laenor’s broodmare!<br />
<br />
Whoops, dial it back and answer the man.<br />
<br />
“No, Father. I intend to wait for a year or two,” I told him. He frowned, anger evident on his features.<br />
<br />
“It is your duty-”<br />
<br />
“I understand my duty well, Father, but might I remind you of how your own mother died? My mother? Her mother? Even Queen Alysanne lost babes!” I snapped. He took a deep breath to retort but I held up a hand. “I am exhausted and wish to return to my rooms,”<br />
<br />
That really wasn’t a lie but I doubt Laenor would let me sleep before we’d flicked through the pages together.<br />
<br />
“Of course, Daughter. Ser Criston, please escort the Princess back her rooms.” Ouch, okay, I had that coming. Yelling at a King was not cool and all that but you really have to rub it in, Viserys?<br />
<br />
The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard was silent as we made out way back. From the way his jaw was clenched, he was angry. No doubt Alicent would receive a report of tonights events. I nearly crashed into him when he stopped.<br />
<br />
“Larys Strong?” he asked, finally.<br />
<br />
“What are you talking about?” I asked. He spun around to face me.<br />
<br />
“You’ll fuck Larys Strong but you will not have me?” he hissed. His hands were flexing around the hilt of his sword. I did not like where this was going. “When Prince Daemon nearly killed you, I defended you. I fought for you! You would take that disgusting boy-lover and the fucking clubfoot over me!?”<br />
<br />
“You defended me, yes. You did your duty as a Kingsguard. Care to remember what else to oath of the Kingsguard commands? As for Larys, I did not fuck him. You know I did not. I am loyal to my husband. To Laenor Velaryon. Not to Daemon Targaryen. Not to Harwin or Larys Strong. And certainly not to you. And if you insult my husband in such a manner again, I will have you killed.” The arctic tone of my voice caused him to stiffen, his hand clenched tightly around the hilt of his sword, his face turn to a mottled white of pure fury.<br />
<br />
“Whore!” he hissed.<br />
<br />
“If I am whore, Criston, what does it say about you that I will not have you?”<br />
<br />
I was saved from his ire and rage by Harwin and one of the Cargyll twins rounding the corner and talking loudly. No doubt they saw my furious expression and Criston pulling back from me like a child with his hand in the cookie jar. The two newcomers paused.<br />
<br />
“Ser Cargyll, Harwin. Returning to the Tower of the Hand?” I asked. Harwin was quick to tell me that his father had dispatched Ser Cargyll to fetch him but the knight in question was keeping a cool eye on Ser Criston. No doubt Viserys would receive the report we had argued and promptly dismiss it like every report of Criston’s behaviour in regards to me and Alicent.<br />
<br />
“Thank you for escorting me this far, Ser Cole.” I slipped by him before he could insist on walking me the entire way. “Good night, Ser Erryk, Ser Harwin.”<br />
<br />
Laenor was still in my rooms when I returned, pacing up and down in some amount of agitation.<br />
<br />
“Oh, are you well? The King is apparently in a fine temper to learn you’ve been messing with the Strong’s.” I put my bundle down on the table we had eaten on not so long ago.<br />
<br />
“I set him straight,” I replied, negelecting to mention our spat. Gods, what the hell went off in that man’s head? To name his daughter heir but then screw her over in every other conceivable way? If you hate me, why make me heir? If you want me dead, why not just have me killed?<br />
<br />
My head span and I grimaced. I couldn’t take any more of this yo-yo’ing. If everyday in Kings Landing was this exciting I’m going to give serious thought to moving to Ibb or something.<br />
<br />
“You told him about the book?” Laenor asked, eyes wide. I shook my head and unfolded the blanket, grimacing at the state it was in. Laenor moved over, quickly collecting the pages before stopping to give a puzzled look at the rest of the items.<br />
<br />
“Is that the wooden sword you stole from me at the Great Council?” he sounded dumbfounded, even as I smiled.<br />
<br />
“You lost it in a bet,” I replied and he huffed before chuckling himself. “The blanket belonged to my mother and her mother before her. I intend to get it restored and give it to our child.”<br />
<br />
A reassuring hand rubbed between my shoulder blades and he didn’t even tense up this time. Laenor put the pages aside. Apart from his sword, the pages and the blanket itself nothing really had any sentimental value. One of the maids was summoned to take the blanket away for cleaning and Laenor quickly hid his old toy from it’s ‘original thief’, he’d declared it his own ‘heirloom’. Then it was time to get to business.<br />
<br />
We split the pages and read through them. I’d managed to get the agriculture ones, the ones that described selective breeding, crop rotation, farming machinery and food preservation. I’d also managed to get half of the notes on distillation. It was clear from my confused rambling I hadn’t really ‘gotten’ the concept of farming. For example, I’d made mention of a plough but there were no descriptions on how it would help, it’s purpose or even how it differed from normal farming techniques.<br />
<br />
I dutifully wrote down a summary from what I could understand and glanced at Laenor. He was rigid in his seat, eyes flickering back and forth with excitement written large on his face.<br />
<br />
That… probably wasn’t good.<br />
<br />
“Rhaenyra! Look at this! If it’s right this could change everything.” He slid a page yellowed with time across to me and I picked it up. I gotten halfway through talking about mould when I realised what this entailed. Penicillin. I glanced back at Laenor who looked as if he was barely stopping himself from bouncing in his chair. Would Penicillin even work? Gun powder had not. If it did the possibilities were endless but the question was whether the spore even existed in Westeros.<br />
<br />
“A medicine that can treat a massive range of illnesses. A near cure all,” he squeaked. “And look here. A section on birthing!”<br />
<br />
Another paper was slid across. In a past life, my sister had been a midwife. For all that the concept of birth terrified me, I’d still been eager to listen to the stories told. Here’s a fun fact about midwifery, forceps are really, really useful for preventing unnecessary deaths in child birth. In our world they’d been invented by this one guy who’d kept them a secret, going so far as to blindfold mothers during birth so no one would find out his trick. And then his family had done the same thing for the next 150 years.<br />
<br />
I suddenly wanted to throw up. Could this have saved my mother’s life? As if reading my thoughts, Laenor laid a hand on mine.<br />
<br />
“You were a child. Even if you had shown Runciter, he wouldn’t have listened,” he said kindly, before pulling free another page. “Look at this one! A simple device for amplifying sound. Simple! Yet not one Maester has ever thought to use something like this.”<br />
<br />
Numb, I left him to his discovery's and summoned a maid to help me prepare for bed. I fell asleep soon after to Laenor’s exclamations of excitement and frantic scribbling from the other room.</div>

								<div class="bbWrapper">When I awoke and staggered out of bed regretting all my life choices, Laenor was still in the same place he’d been the night before, paper littering the table and floor around him. He waved me over and I collapsed into a chair opposite him. Mornings were hard. A maid hurried over and presented me with a cup of juice and some fruit, one of mine that arrived yesterday. I thanked her before turning my attention back to my husband, who was sorting the paper explosion into some kind of order.<br />
<br />
“I’ve managed to create a system in which the papers are filed into general groups. A few of the big ones are Agriculture, Medicine and oddly enough Glass. Whoever wrote this really, really had a high opinion of glass,” he told me. Sue me, it’s super useful for everything and it’s a travesty we all just accept Myr makes the best glass. “From there I’ve ordered them into how much detail the text goes into producing the ‘technology’. I think we can start work on the Agricultural technologies on Dragonstone and Driftmark this year even.”<br />
<br />
“You wish to start on Dragonstone and Driftmark? Why not the Crownlands? We need to start gathering and strengthening allies as soon as possible,” I asked, ignoring the slightly wild look in his eyes. He’d definitely not slept. His doublet was creased, his eyes dark and his hair an unbound mess. I resisted the urge to comb my hands through it, he wouldn’t appreciate it. He got defensive when it came to his hair.<br />
<br />
“Have you ever worked with farmers?” I shook my head. My duties at Dragonstone mostly bought me into contact with the small time merchants in the port. “Well, they’re stubborn. Very stubborn. Not they they don’t have good reason, if they all try something new and they all fail then they do not eat and neither does anyone else.”<br />
<br />
“The section on farming machinery is very vague and we’ll probably require the help of the Wisdom’s producing anything from it but the idea of actively breeding plants and animals for traits? We do that already but just not on the scale the book describes in necessary for fast change. The field system suggested, although I admit I’ve never heard of Norfolk, could be implemented across the islands within a year. Two at most. It’s underlying theory could spawn more technology the writer of this book couldn’t dream of!”<br />
<br />
“And once we prove it works, we’ll be hip deep in Lord’s wanting to know how we did it.” I said slowly, unable to stop the cat-like smile of satisfaction growing across my face. He nodded along, eye bright now that I’d finally ‘gotten it’. I eyed his other stacks and had an idea.<br />
<br />
“Laenor, have you looked anymore into the section on birthing?” I asked. He nodded and tapped a stack of pages, I recognised some of the terms. Had he seriously copied everything? I scooped a few of the pages up and found that yes, he had copied the entire thing by hand. He’d even tried producing sketches of the things I’d described. Some of them were remarkably close and some… well, they could use work.<br />
<br />
“Larys said yesterday that his mother died in childbirth.” I said slowly. “Have you any relatives who…”<br />
<br />
“Well, Father hardly likes to tell everyone but my birth ended Mother’s chances of another child. She struggled with Laena as well.” It was an awkward subject. Septons and Septas liked to wax lyrical about the miracle of birth and how the birthing bed was a woman’s ultimate duty but no one liked to acknowledge how dangerous it was, how often women died or lost their children.<br />
<br />
“Larys said that most Maesters do not overly study child birth.” Laenor snorted in response.<br />
<br />
“Maesters study everything,” he replied but my brain was spinning now. Taking what I knew of Westeros and of the Maesters and of how nearly every family in every generation had a tale of someone dying needlessly and comparing with vague memories of a sister who’d studied for years to be a midwife, who’d still not been allowed to do solo births until she had assisted others and had proven experience. Unbidden, my mind drifted to the doddering Runciter and the sneering Mellos and even my own Gerardys.<br />
<br />
In truth, I had never been fond of the Maesters. Runciter had merely turned that dislike into a hardened idea to do something something about them in the distant future.<br />
<br />
I thought about Westeros’ idea of midwives. Midwives were a tradition of the smallfolk and were usually older women who’d gotten the role through experience than study. It was sort of assumed anyone who was anyone had a Maester. If you were having to consult midwives and healers then you were as good as saying you didn’t have the money or prestige for one of Westeros’ knights of the mind.<br />
<br />
“That’s right. They do. How could any man truly know a subject if he spends half a year studying at best?” I asked, slowly. After all, doctors studied for years and still had to jump through hoops to practise. Was this why so many died? Not malice or some conspiracy but simple mistakes made by men who’d never assisted in birth before. After all, the Maesters served a castle. They didn’t attend the birth of every pregnant woman in a ten mile radius. They might, if that woman was lucky, help with a favoured servant.<br />
<br />
Helping anyone who asked would damage their exclusivity, of course. People might start associating Maesters with... gasp! The smallfolk! Laenor was looking at me strangely.<br />
<br />
“Think about it. How many times do you think Maester Gerardys has assisted in a birth? And he has several silver links.” Now Laenor looked thoughtful, probably because he knew the answer was zero.<br />
<br />
“You believe that the inexperience of the Maesters is what kills their patients?” He asked slowly. I nodded eagerly.<br />
<br />
“Yes! We have access to a set of ideas that could revolutionise medicine. We could create an entirely new set of healers, ones who study only the art of healing and may even specialise further into diseases or birthing.” Laenor stroked his chin but his mouth was twisted, as if he were wrestling with his thoughts and losing.<br />
<br />
“The Maesters have always been Westeros’ healers. They have access to knowledge built up over centuries. Even if what is contained in the book is enough to challenge their supremacy, we’d need a massive investment to do so,” he pointed out, tone doubtful. Ah, push back. I’ve presented something new too fast and it’s straining his Westerosi worldview. After all better farming is fine but knocking out a major pillar of the Maesters power? Questioning a system that’s been in use for thousands of years?<br />
<br />
“Please, Laenor, any of this technology is unlikely to make the Maesters happy. Take the press for example? They make their money off of controlling access to books, deciding which books are copied and which are not. We could print any book a hundred times over for a fraction of the cost and in a fraction of the time.”<br />
<br />
His face screwed up, a lifetime of socialisation telling him that this would not work.<br />
<br />
“It’s much too far, much too fast. We’re trying to win you a throne, not take Westeros apart and put it back together again in a new order,” he pointed out finally. Damn him, he had a point. All but declaring war on the Maesters would likely scare a lot lords on principle alone. To say nothing of whose ears the Maesters themselves would start whispering in.<br />
<br />
“For now we can focus on the farming and getting the Wisdoms to Dragonstone, but Laenor, I want to train midwives as well. That is not negotiable.” Laenor studied me for a few moments after that announcement. I finished the last of the fruit, ignoring his silent condemnation. I was not going to risk dying in a childbirth any more than I needed too and if we could prove they worked, that they were better than Maesters? Well, Westerosi lords would clamour for them. It would be the first crack in their dominance over Westeros.<br />
<br />
“Very well. I’ll add it to the instructions I send to Dragonstone.” I watched as he pulled a sheet free and jotted down a few lines. I drank my juice and listened to the sound of his scribbling, allowing my eyes to drift closed.<br />
<br />
“I’m sending Laena to Dragonstone with all of this. She should be able to make a round trip in a day if she pushes Vhagar a little. Then I’m going to see Wisdom Jerrett so he can start getting a selection of Alchemists to Dragonstone,” He told me, rising from his seat.<br />
<br />
“Perhaps you should change first?” I asked, nodding at his less than appropriate attire. He pulled a face. “You know certain people will have a field day if they see you sprinting around the city looking like that.”<br />
<br />
“You’re right. It’s just… Rhaenyra, I have been trained to take the lordship of an island. My knowledge is trade, as shameful as most will find that, and even I can see that there isn’t a single technology in here that won’t improve lives across all of Westeros.” He ran an agitated hand through his hair.<br />
<br />
I let him leave with the promise he’d at least bathe before speaking with Wisdom Jerrett and not give away too much of the technology contained within it’s pages until the Guild was under our thumb and indebted to us. I sipped the last of my juice and leant back in my chair. Was I making a mistake?<br />
<br />
Even if I was wrong, it was too late now. Laenor had seen the pages. He knew that they were invaluable in more ways the money it would bring us. Used correctly they would secure Targaryen and Velaryon dominance for centuries to come. There would be no gradual decline as the family desperately tried to command unruly vassals, no civil wars that our opponents had any hope to win...<br />
<br />
Ah. Considering the general quality of Targaryen rulers going forward, that’s going to be a problem.<br />
<br />
On that horrifying thought I forced myself to rise, calling my maids to me. I had errands to run before a meeting with Lord Wendwater and then a meeting with Lord Celtigar. I would need to impress both if my work to sway the Crownlands was to make a good start. I couldn’t rely on just the Crownlands though. So after I had changed and bathed, I sat down and wrote to my cousin.<br />
<br />
I had last seen Jeyne at my wedding. She’d seemed cheerful and friendly enough, at least when the swarms of potential suitors weren’t present, but I hadn’t been thinking politically then. I’d had visions of professional soldiers armed with muskets dancing before my eyes. I hadn’t bothered playing politics because I hadn’t thought I needed too. In retrospect, even had the Black Powder been viable, that had been a mistake.<br />
<br />
So I was sure to remain warm but diplomatic, without assuming to much about how much leeway our shared blood would buy me. I enquired about her health, how the Vale was, whether she had her eye on any suitors and finally, whether she’d allow me to visit in the near future. The letter was too long and heavy to send by raven so I paid for a courier to get it to Jeyne post-haste which gave me another idea. If I was going to damage the Maesters as healers and archivists, why not damage their hold on communications too?<br />
<br />
The days turned into weeks as Laenor and I charmed our way through court. I acquired three ladies-in-waiting, one from House Stokeworth and the two Strong girls. The last two were odd in a way, I understood Lyonel disdained mine and Alicent’s games, preferring to focus on the practical sides of ruling a kingdom. As far as I understood, sending his daughters to me was less a show of support and more a way of saying that should my father die suddenly he would act in accordance with his wishes.<br />
<br />
Gods, I hope I can stop this guy from burning to death. Having Otto as Hand when Viserys died would suck.<br />
<br />
Marya Stokeworth was a plump but pretty girl who fussed over everyone. I’d been enacting my Margaery Tyrell inspired plan to win over King’s Landing by visiting a succession of orphanages when she'd entered my service and I think it had awoken something in her. She’d begun organising sewing rings and charity parties, chasing me to enquire as to whether I could help with funding.<br />
<br />
And since she was doing it in my name… well, Alicent wasn’t too popular amongst the occupants of the city anymore.<br />
<br />
The two Strong girls were called Alys and Sera. Twins, they took more after Harwin than Larys physically. Both were pretty with the Strong nose, their father’s height and blue eyes although thankfully, they didn’t take after their older brother in attitude or intelligence. They weren’t quite Larys levels of smart but they were quick-witted at least and knew their manners. I suspected they were less thrilled by Marya’s enforced sewing circles but they went along with it well enough, preferring to spend their time sewing by sharing the sort of inside jokes that only twins had.<br />
<br />
Laenor acquired a squire from House Rosby named Alton who he swore was a good lad at heart but had me half-convinced he had nothing resembling a personality in the few brief times I’d met him.<br />
<br />
With both of us turning the charms on the court, the Black faction went from strength to strength.<br />
<br />
The Wisdoms, under the watchful eye of Jerrett, left on a ship bearing my colours two weeks after Laenor’s meeting with them. I was given to understand that the competition for a place within the new campus had been fierce. The idea of these ‘lost’ technologies had sent the Guild into a frenzy. Jerrett had still been trying to insist the Guild’s true purpose was magic even as his co-workers fought over glass production techniques and knowledge of the nitrogen cycle.<br />
<br />
Viserys remained as spineless as ever, as predicted Ser Cargyll’s report about Criston’s behaviour did nothing after Alicent had stepped in on his behalf. I did manage to spend time with Helaena after I all but petitioned Viserys in open court. Alicent had been sibling hoarding and coming up with excuse after excuse to not let me see any of them.<br />
<br />
I took the girl to the Dragonpit for a ride on Syrax which she’d talked about non-stop for three days. It was nice to be the big sister to a sibling that thought the world of you and Alicent's twitching was just the cherry on the cake. Aegon, annoyingly, still avoided me like I had the plague when he could and when he couldn’t his interactions were icy, hostile but never outright rude. My one attempt to win Aemond over ended when he hit me in the shin with his wooden sword. It left a spectacular bruise and I was quite put out about it.<br />
<br />
Daeron remained pink, round and loud.<br />
<br />
As I approached the month mark, a cutter from Gulltown bearing Grafton colours arrived with a letter bearing the Arryn seal. Apparently, it would be impossible for me to meet with Jeyne right now as the Eyrie had been sealed due to an outbreak of illness suspected to, from the way the letter writer described it, super plague. It had been signed by a Ser Arnold Arryn, Keeper of the Gates of the Moon.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I was calling bullshit on that one.</div>

			"articleBody": "Posting this here from AH. Quite a bit of catching up to do so I'll post up to the interludes everyday until this thread catches up.\n-\nSaltpeter, Charcoal and Sulfur. The three ingredients one would need in order to make black powder.\n\nSaltpeter had been acquired from a very awkward conversation with Harwin Strong. My attempts to distract him from why I needed all the bat poo I could remove from Harrenhal had, for an entire week, had him under the impression we were lovers and started five brand new rumours at court that I’m sure made Alicent all tingly.\n\nSulfur had been the next on my list and had left me with a bit of a dilemma. The easiest way to get your hands on Sulfur in Westeros was to buy it from the Dornish. The Hellholt was lousy with the stuff and the Ullers were always happy for the extra income from it’s sale. Unfortunately, that is the easiest method for anyone who isn’t a Targaryen. Another way is distilling Pyrite. Pyrite was mostly found in the Westerlands which meant dealing with the Lannisters. Lannisters or the Dornish, I’m hard pressed to say who are the more traitorous.\n\nI was saved from my dilemma by Ser Joffrey. No doubt the Ullers are wondering why a scion of the Stormlands requires so much sulfur. He'd refused to set up a reoccurring delivery until I proved that my experiments worked. Bah, I'd show him.\n\nCharcoal is the easiest. Charcoal burners litter Westeros and it was simple matter of raiding Driftmark for a small supply. Grind all three up, properly measure the ingredients, mix carefully but well and you have yourself the modest little powder that’s going to ensure a certain little sulky brat never lays so much of a finger on the throne that’s rightfully yours.\n\nNot that I’m taking it personally of course.\n\nAn old pain lanced through my fingers as I prepared to transfer the powder to it’s new home. I paused and flexed them, grimacing at the ache. Grandmaester Runciter had been a genius in more ways than one. Law, Architecture... He could advise on anything a king might need to know but the man had been a god awful doctor. As both I and my mother had discovered. I continued with the exercises until the pain abated.\n\nVery carefully, I scooped my black powder into the metal casing and tightened the cap. Whilst Dragonstone certainly lives up to it’s name, I’d rather not blow up the castle I’ve only been in possession of for six months. Alicent would love that.\n\nNot that Dragonstone couldn’t do with a bit of exploding. Dragonstone the castle that is. The island itself wasn’t a problem. What farmland it had was rich and productive, the weather was pleasant and the views at times could be breathtaking. When not in my lab creating the recipe for Alicent’s downfall, I’ve taken to exploring it fully on the back of Syrax.\n\nThe problem is whoever built Dragonstone the castle apparently didn’t share my views on the island. Dragonstone itself had been built in the shadow of the Dragonmont, the towering active volcano that dominated the island. This had several knock-on effects. First it meant that the scenic views, rolling farmlands and gorgeous weather were on the other side of the damnable thing and secondly, the shadow from the mountain cast the castle proper, and the small town surrounding it, into a permanent gloom.\n\nThey’d then topped their monument to poorly thought out architecture in stone dragons. Huge stone dragons, small stone dragons, wall mounted stone dragons, statues of dragons… All made from the same fused black rock I had come to learn was indicative of Valyrian buildings.\n\nAs if that wasn’t enough, later architects had decided there weren't enough dragons and had carved more into the walls, the floors, railings and banisters. No wonder Stannis had gone mad living here and if he was actually Azor Ahai and did have the power to wake dragons from stone then he was going to be a one man second coming of the bloody freehold.\n\nTwo guards in Targaryen livery fell into step behind me as a left the lab with my creation tucked under my arm. One of the many stewards of Dragonstone would ensure the rooms were cleaned and locked. Not that any totally-not-Alicent’s-spies would be able to figure out what I was doing before it was too late. Still, this is Westeros and it never hurts to be pro-active about you enemies.\n\nI realised I was scowling when a maid all but leapt out of my way. I would have to check that. I rearranged my face into what I hoped was polite smile and made my way to the small courtyard I’d had cleared for testing. The corridor that lead to the exit had the look of one that had been neglected since the Red Keep had been constructed.\n\nMy two guards took up positions by the door, out of the way. Happily, my earlier instructions for the set up had been heeded and a brazier was merrily burning away. It was heading towards late afternoon and I probably shouldn’t be testing things so close to the evening meal. It was considered rude and Lord Corlys was always ready to point out my shortcomings.\n\nI poured a modest amount of powder onto the flagstone, before withdrawing and retrieved a wooden splint. I had to be extra careful here. All my work would be for nothing if I set myself alight. Gently, I lowered the splint into the powder before stepping even further back.\n\nGenerally, Black powder will ignite if you look at it wrong. In the open, like mine, it should burn. Confined however, it produces an explosion which is what makes it useful for flinging bits of metal about at high speed.\n\nAt least that was what it was supposed to do.\n\nI could only watch with a sinking sort of horror as the flame sputtered and died amongst the completely unignited and very much not on fire powder. From the corner, I heard my guards move to intercept someone. I stared at the unburnt spot and tried to set my emotions in order.\n\nFrustration: Check\nSomething weirdly close to grief: Check\nA sinking feeling that I have to face the Dance of Dragons without my easy mode solution of firearms: Also check.\n\nSomeone up there is laughing at me, I just know it.\n\n“Rhaenyra!”\n\nI jumped as a hand collided with my shoulder, pulling me from my one woman self-pity party. Unsurprisingly, it was yet another problem I would have to deal with before I could drop-kick Alicent all the way back to the Hightower. Laenor. Another set of unfortunate feelings rose up inside me and I resisted the urge to clock him for taking my pity party and switching it to a ‘oh no original Rhaenyra is definitely still here somewhere’ existential horror.\n\n“What?” I bit out. I don’t even know my own age anymore but I’m damn sure I’m too young to be dealing with the question of whether I’m keeping someone prisoner inside their own body or the knowledge that a continent spanning super war is on it’s way because Alicent is raging b- bad person.\n\n“My Lord Father has requested your presence for an early dinner.”\n\nIgnoring how breathtakingly rude it is for Lord Corlys to be 'requesting' things in my own damn castle, Laenor doesn’t even look the slightest bit apologetic for the delivery of bad news. I cast another glance at the black powder with the vain hope that maybe it will set alight and the first time was somehow a fluke. It remained inert and I sighed heavily before I could stop myself.\n\n“Did your experiment not go to plan?” asked Laenor, peering around me.\n\nI gestured to the black powder again with another sigh and he gives me a sympathetic look.\n\n“Sorry it didn’t work out. Perhaps this is a sign that Alchemy should not be a path to the throne.”\n\nHe was trying to sound conciliatory but it wasn't hard to infer he found to whole business distasteful. He may be a gay man in the heart of grimderp Westeros but beyond matters of inheritance and love, he was remarkably closed minded.\n\nI fixed him with what I hoped was an intimidating glare. He raised his hands in mock surrender before pushing some of his long silver hair from his face.\n\nThe Rhaenyra in me was thrilled. He was a beautiful man, tall with delicate features and long silver hair. His eyes were the typical Valyrian violet and he held himself in a particularly regal manner. I had, thankfully, failed to somehow butterfly away Rhaenyra’s beauty. Trust me, she had well deserved her title of ‘Realm’s Delight’. A lifetime of lessons in deportment had meant I could match Laenor’s regal grace with my own. On the surface, we were a striking couple.\n\nThe current power couple of Westeros.\n\n“It’s beginning to be spoken about at court,” he continued. I frowned. He didn’t have to say who was talking about it. It was Alicent, it was always Alicent. My Father would only intervene if anything became blatant and even then he was unlikely to do anything that would actually protect me. I had seen it all play out in the past and in all likeliness, I would see it play out again. I flexed my fingers as they throbbed again in reminder.\n\n“Perhaps it is time for you to find someone-”\n\nI cut him off with a wave. I knew how that had gone for the original Rhaenyra. Three obvious bastards had tanked her support harder than anything Alicent could have ever done. Something I know would have tickled orginal Alicent pink if this Alicent was anything to go by.\n\n“I have already told you-” Laenor cut me of this time, his face twisted in unhappiness.\n\n“I can not. I have already explained. I can not.” I understood and sympathised to a degree. He was a gay man and no amount of closing his eyes and thinking of Driftmark was going to change that. It still didn’t change the fact that bearing anyone else’s children was a risk I could not take.\n\n“I’m not about to have children now anyway, Laenor. It’s too early. Childbirth killed both my mother and her mother too. We have a few years to find a solution.”\n\nHe didn’t look convinced. That was probably Lord Corlys’ doing. No doubt he was hammering the need for a quick heir into his son’s head. In canon, Rhaenyra had already been pregnant with Jacaerys by this point. I suppose the lack of heir was spooking my so called ‘greatest supporter’.\n\n“I fear that will not placate the Factions at court,” replied Laenor, meaning Lord Corlys even if he didn't actually mean to imply that.\n\nOn that last miserable note, I guided him back out of the courtyard, leaving orders for the stewards to clear the mess and to be careful with the powder.",

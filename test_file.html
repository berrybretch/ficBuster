  <br />
  Marcus lounged in the Eagle’s Nest, slowly sinking into one of the bar’s
  comfortable leather couches. He was nursing his second tall glass of beer that
  night, mindful not to let the pleasant buzz muddle his thoughts. He wanted his
  mind to stay relatively sharp, but also keep the atmosphere relaxed. Marcus
  was admittedly a lightweight, in more ways than one, and it didn’t take much
  alcohol to get a good buzz going—unlike his best friend Spencer, who sat in a
  matching armchair to his left.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer charitably described himself as ‘husky,’ in stark contrast to Marcus,
  and as a result Spencer could pound away drinks all night long and barely show
  it. He was currently demolishing a fourth beer. That was fine, since he wasn’t
  here to do the talking anyway. Spencer was around more to provide Marcus moral
  support and, admittedly, to complement him with a more normal and less serious
  side of things. It had been Spencer’s idea to invite the third member of their
  little group.<br />
  <br />
  On Marcus’s right sat Seth, the younger brother of an old high school friend
  of Spencer’s. Seth might have been okay with drinking alongside Spencer and
  Marcus—at least partly because he couldn’t get easy access to booze anywhere
  else—but he wasn’t a member of the Empire Eighty-Eight like Spencer and Marcus
  were. Marcus hoped to change that tonight. He had been noticed for his budding
  talent at changing minds, having brought two other members into the Empire in
  just six months, and adding a third would help him move up in the
  organization.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tended to prefer the deep and serious approach to recruitment, but
  Spencer was good at just making friends. He often reminded Marcus of a dog, in
  both good and bad ways. Spencer was friendly, silly, and a bit too fond of
  food, but he was brave and loyal when it counted the most. Marcus couldn’t
  have asked for a better friend, or a better partner in crime to try winning
  over hearts and minds. Spencer could handle the heart, while Marcus would
  target the mind.<br />
  <br />
  Seth had started out nervous when he’d entered the bar, but with the help of
  Spencer’s happy-go-lucky teasing and antics, he’d mellowed out considerably.
  That was good—it would make the next part easier.<br />
  <br />
  “What’s with the dopey smile?” Spencer asked Marcus.<br />
  <br />
  “Just thinkin’ about days gone by. You know. High school. How glad I am to put
  that shit behind me,” said Marcus, smirking at Seth before taking another sip
  of beer.<br />
  <br />
  “Yeah, man. Ancient history,” Seth responded with heavy irony, conveniently
  ignoring that he was 17 and still a senior at Winslow High.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer snorted. “Oh, fuck off with your <i>ancient history</i>. If it weren’t
  for us vouching for you, Liza would have tossed you out on your ass for
  showing up with that two-bit fake I.D.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth gestured at Marcus. “He’s only one grade ahead of me, why aren’t you
  getting on <i>his</i> case?”<br />
  <br />
  “It’s not about drinking age, it’s about who you <i>know</i>. Marcus and I are
  members of the club. You’re just our guest,” Spencer said sagely.<br />
  <br />
  “Come on, Spence,” Marcus gently chided. “He’s just here to relax and have a
  good time. This isn’t a members-only bar.”<br />
  <br />
  Spencer scoffed. “Like hell it isn’t! Look around, do you see
  <i>anyone</i> who’s not white?”<br />
  <br />
  “It’s more than just that. If all they did was keep out Merchants and homeless
  trash, that would be kind of a low bar,” Marcus pointed out.<br />
  <br />
  “Pun intended, right? You get weird when you drink, I ever tell you that? All
  serious and philly-<i>philosophical</i>. It’s fuckin’... nerdy as shit.”
  Spencer said, stumbling a bit over his words.<br />
  <br />
  “Whereas <i>you</i> get all tongue-tied,” Marcus deadpanned.<br />
  <br />
  “I’ll have you know I’m fluent in sign language too, jackass.” said Spencer,
  flipping Marcus the bird and then launching into an elaborate pantomime with a
  lot of pointing and unintelligible arm-chopping motions.<br />
  <br />
  “The hell are you even doing?” Seth laughed.<br />
  <br />
  “Lettin’ Marcus know he’s a sad little stick-in-the-mud.” said Spencer,
  stopping his wild gestures.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shrugged. Spencer’s teasing had long since stopped making him feel
  offended, not when he knew Spencer wasn’t really serious and tried to insult
  just about everyone he thought he could get away with.<br />
  <br />
  “Come on, you fuckin’ <i>lump</i>. Don’t you at least wanna play pool or
  something?” Spencer wheedled. He could be surprisingly shrewish for a guy with
  a beer belly and deep baritone voice.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus rolled his eyes. “Even <i>sober</i> you couldn’t hit the broad side of
  a barn, much less a billiard ball. Maybe try your luck with Landon over there,
  he looks like he can barely stand. If you can beat him, get back to me.”<br />
  <br />
  Spencer stood up and walked off, muttering. “I dunno why I hang around with
  such a stuck-up little toothpick.”<br />
  <br />
  Chuckling at his friend, Marcus settled back, relaxing. He let the sounds of
  the room wash over him, the charging beat of the rock music playing at medium
  volume in the background, the murmur of the crowd, the clink of glasses and
  silverware. He loved relaxing at the Eagle’s Nest. It was a safe haven full of
  simple pleasures, a stress-free environment compared to the howling goddamn
  insanity that was Brockton Bay.<br />
  <br />
  Seth, however, was fidgeting and seemed quite restless. His fear at being
  busted for underage drinking had evaporated, but he still looked like he
  didn’t quite know what to do with himself in this place where he stuck out
  like a sore thumb. He was the only one in the whole bar with shoulder-length
  brown hair, everyone else was either a natural or dyed blonde like Marcus, or
  a skinhead like Spencer.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus waited patiently. The topic of the Empire’s ideology was going to come
  up eventually. People didn’t listen when you tried to shove your worldview
  down their throats, they just got defensive and shut down, he knew that much
  from bitter experience with his mom and sister. If you just left the door open
  and answered their questions, though, they’d be a lot more receptive to what
  you had to say.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus’s gaze fell on the elaborately wrought iron eagle mounted in the corner
  near the ceiling, holding the corners of two flags in its claws. One was the
  Imperial German war ensign, the other an Iron Cross on a black background. It
  made Marcus feel a warm flush of pride.<br />
  <br />
  “Hey, Marcus. What are you thinking about?” Seth finally asked.<br />
  <br />
  “Just appreciating the vexillolography,” Marcus said, nodding at the flag.<br />
  <br />
  “Gesundheit,” said Seth, raising an eyebrow.<br />
  <br />
  “It means the art of the flags. There’s a lot of meaning behind every element
  in the colors and symbols.” Marcus said.<br />
  <br />
  “I’ve been meaning to ask you about that—not the flag, I mean, but all the
  Nazi stuff. Like, I know the Nazis had some cool shit and all, but I don’t get
  why you and your, uh, <i>friends</i> are all gung-ho about them. You’re not
  even German.” Seth pointed out.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus chuckled, leaning forward. “You know, I’m <i>so</i> glad you asked
  about the <i>good news...!”</i> he said with mock brightness, doing his best
  door-knocking evangelist impression.<br />
  <br />
  “Oh, God, spare me the sales pitch. Forget I said anything!” said Seth,
  covering his eyes.<br />
  <br />
  They both laughed together, in that un-self-conscious way that only partially
  inebriated people could manage.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned back, sighing after the laughing fit passed. “Seriously, though,
  dude. I won’t push, but do you really want to know?”<br />
  <br />
  Seth shrugged. “I mean, kinda? I’ve always been more interested in the biker
  and metalhead scenes, but if you hang out around those long enough, you pick
  up a thing or two. I don’t really get it, though. I mean, don’t get me wrong,
  I hate those ABB motherfuckers, but I don’t get the jump from that to, like,
  full-on Nazis.”<br />
  <br />
  “I think you understand more than you think,” Marcus said, holding up a hand.
  “Maybe it’ll help to give you an example. For me, I started coming around when
  I began noticing that something was really wrong with the world.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth scoffed. “There’s a <i>lot</i> wrong with the world. There’s wars and
  Endbringers and the Water Crisis and all that shit.”<br />
  <br />
  “I mean besides the obvious. There’s something rotten with
  <i>normal</i> people, the way they think and act. You know, just culture in
  general,” Marcus pressed, waving a finger in a circle as if to encompass the
  whole world. “Didn’t everything seem so much more hopeful when we were kids? I
  mean, we were both born after the Golden Age of Superheroes ended, but things
  weren’t so bad on the surface. Behemoth came around before I could really
  remember, but people didn’t really know what that had <i>meant</i> yet. Do you
  remember when Jörmungandr first appeared?”<br />
  <br />
  “Who?” asked Seth, his brow knitting in confusion.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned in closer, quietly listing off the names of the beast.
  “Jörmungandr. The Second. The Serpent. <i>Leviathan</i>.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus saw a spark of interest in Seth’s eyes, and knew he’d hit pay dirt, a
  true connection. The truth that can only be uncovered by shared experience.<br />
  <br />
  “I do,” Seth said, his voice coming out hushed, subconsciously mirroring
  Marcus’ own serious tone. “What’s that got to do with Nazis, though?”<br />
  <br />
  <i>“Everything,”</i> Marcus said, spreading his arms wide. “It’s all
  connected. I’ll tell you the story, if you like.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth still looked a little skeptical, but he’d picked up on Marcus’s serious
  mood. He nodded solemnly.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus mentally girded himself, disciplining his thoughts into order. It was
  hard being a recruiter. He had to bare his soul and confront some heavy shit,
  the dark truths that everyone knew but preferred to ignore. And he had to do
  all that with total conviction and confidence, without flinching away from the
  uncomfortable parts. It opened Marcus up to mockery or attacks or joking
  deflections, but it was necessary. People could sense insincerity a mile away.
  He had to make himself vulnerable to be believed, then build that connection
  up into something strong.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus took a deep breath, and began his story.<br />
  <br />
  “One of my earliest memories was watching TV with my big sister, some cartoon
  or something. Suddenly, the movie cut out, and it started showing the news, so
  my sister tried changing the channel, but it was all the same thing on
  <i>every</i> channel, talking about Jörmungandr appearing for the first time.
  I was just a little kid, I didn’t know what was going on, and Cass wouldn’t
  tell me, so I called out to Mom. She came into the living room, and then she
  just <i>froze</i>. I don’t really remember what the news was saying, but I’ll
  never forget the look on her face. How she went all still and white. Seeing my
  mom, standing there like a statue, just... I could tell she was rooted by pure
  <i>fear, </i>and it scared me more than anything I’d ever seen in my life.
  Then she grabbed both of us, hugging us so hard it <i>hurt,</i> and even
  though she couldn’t stop <i>crying,</i> she still didn’t look away from the
  TV, not even once. We didn’t understand what happened, but it was mom’s
  reaction that made it <i>real</i>. After that, I saw the despair everywhere,
  but I didn’t understand it, what that really <i>meant</i> for the world, not
  until years later.”<br />
  <br />
  As Marcus spoke, he felt chills racing down his body, goosebumps rippling out
  over his arms at reliving the memory.<br />
  <br />
  “Are you talking about Leviathan being the reason for the boat graveyard, and
  the city’s economy getting fucked up?” Seth asked as Marcus took a drink to
  soothe his suddenly dry throat.<br />
  <br />
  “That’s only a tiny part of it. <i>Everything</i> went downhill from there,
  <i>everywhere</i>. You and I, our generation, we could feel it even when we
  were kids, and growing up it only got worse. Think about it—when Jörmungandr
  sank Kyushu, that’s when all the immigrants started flooding in. Not just in
  Brockton Bay with the ABB turning the place into a shithole, there’s
  <i>millions</i> of refugees all over, and it’s only going to get a thousand
  times worse in a few years. So what’s <i>wrong</i> with people? They’re all
  <i>terrified, </i>but they’re pretending that they aren’t. People are too busy
  with sports or celebrities or drugs or whatever pointless, petty bullshit they
  use to distract themselves from thinking.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth nodded. “Oh yeah. It’s all total bullshit, we can agree on that part.
  People would rather have their comfortable lies instead of the hard truth. I
  don’t sign on to all the race stuff, though.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus felt his cheeks flush a little with his frustration, and hoped it
  didn’t show. The pitch had started well, but now it felt like he was losing
  Seth, so he decided to go for one of his trump cards. “About the race stuff, I
  get it. I do. We’ve been taught from birth it’s bad. Kumbaya and give peace a
  chance and all that shit the mass media pushes to keep everyone in line. But
  you can just as easily say <i>fighting</i> is bad. There’s no room for that
  out in the <i>real</i> world, where things like fighting and racism are
  sometimes <i>necessary</i>. I’ve heard it explained this way, and it really
  stuck with me: think of the world like a sinking ship. Your country—as in,
  your culture, that’s the lifeboat.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth raised a skeptical eyebrow. “So you’re saying we’re like the
  <i>Titanic</i>, and the Jews are like the iceberg or something?”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shook his head, resisting the urge to call out Seth’s stupidity. “No,
  not at all. What I mean is, the ship’s like the world, and it’s already
  sinking, there’s nothing we can do to stop it now. Think of white culture as
  the last lifeboat. Everyone knows it’s their best chance, so everyone’s
  flocking to it. But if too many people try to climb on the lifeboat, they’ll
  sink the whole thing for everyone. Sure, you can give up your spot on the boat
  if you want to be <i>nice</i> or whatever, but then you’re just, y’know,
  adding to the problem, because the guy you let on wants to bring
  <i>his</i> family, <i>his</i> friends, and now suddenly everyone’s fighting
  each other instead of defending the boat. The lifeboat sinks, everyone dies,
  and <i>nobody</i> is better off just because you did the ‘nice’ thing. In
  order to survive, we have to <i>fight,</i> and to fight we have to be united
  by something stronger. A shared culture, shared blood. I know no one
  <i>else</i> is going to fight for me, all the other races only ever stick up
  for themselves. So why shouldn’t we?”<br />
  <br />
  Seth shrugged helplessly. “Look, I’m all for protecting my own culture. I
  don’t have any problem with that, and I’m proud to be white too. It’s a good
  thing, right? I don’t know what else to tell you, though. All the Asians can
  fuck right off back to where they came from, but I don’t see the point of
  being so hung up over the blacks and gays and Jews. It just seems... kinda
  pointless, you know?”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shook his head. “I’m sorry if it’s hard to accept, but including blacks
  and gays and whatever else is a luxury we just can’t <i>afford</i>. Black
  people and their problems are a liability in this fight, you don’t have to
  hate them, but that’s just a <i>fact</i>. They’re less than 13% of the
  population, but they commit the majority of the crimes. White people have an
  IQ of 100 and black people have an IQ of 80. That’s just the truth, and it
  won’t change for anybody’s politically correct <i>bullshit</i>. It’s just
  nature, and it’s nobody’s <i>fault,</i> but whose fault it is doesn’t matter.
  What matters is <i>survival,</i> and I’m sorry, but you’re not gonna survive
  if you rely on black people or gay people. Just look at Africa. Just look at
  the Roman Empire.”<br />
  <br />
  “No, no, no. I get that part, but I just... does it <i>have</i> to be all
  swastikas and Sieg heils and shit? I mean, no offense, but like, it seems like
  you’re going too far in the other direction. This isn’t Germany in the ‘30s.
  It feels like you’re all trying to dress up for Halloween or something,” said
  Seth, looking pointedly at the guy at the bar with a swastika tattoo on his
  neck.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus waved his hand dismissively. “What, the symbols and all that? It’s just
  ways for people to rebel, or support their favorite capes in the Empire. The
  symbolism is our way of saying <i>fuck the system. </i>It’s about reclaiming
  our heritage from all the lies and bullshit, and some people...” Marcus
  gestured at Spencer’s iron cross-decorated jacket before continuing, “...Just
  like that it drives the fuckers nuts.”<br />
  <br />
  “Okay, that’s fine, I guess, I’m not against free speech or whatever.” Seth
  said sulkily, taking a swig of his beer.<br />
  <br />
  Nodding equably, Marcus tried to steer things back on track. “Letting people
  just do their own thing is okay when things are good, but we’ve
  <i>tried</i> mashing people from different cultures together, and it just
  <i>doesn’t work</i>. We need to try something else.”<br />
  <br />
  “Man, come on. It’s not like the Nazis had the best track record either, they
  did some pretty fucked up shit too.” said Seth, chuckling dryly. “Like, even
  if all you said was true, killing all the Jews or whatever just doesn’t seem
  like it would <i>help</i> anything, just make things even worse.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus felt a flash of indignation at the jibe. It was genuinely disturbing to
  hear all the old fallacies and talking points trotted out robotically, almost
  verbatim. The sheep <i>always</i> brought it around to the Holocaust, every
  single time.<br />
  <br />
  “History is written by the victors, you know that. You’ve got to think for
  <i>yourself,”</i> Marcus said, the words coming out more snidely than he
  intended. He took a quick, calming breath, and continued in a more mellow
  tone, “Allied propaganda only gets a pass because they won in the end.
  Nowadays, people think of fascism like this one-sided, cartoonish thing, just
  bad guys for Indiana Jones and Uncle Sam to punch. When normal people think of
  Nazis, they think of black-and-white newsreels with Hitler speaking
  passionately in German—but haven’t you ever noticed they never include any
  subtitles? God forbid people hear a translation, or else they might end up
  <i>agreeing</i> with him.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth frowned. “I mean, I’ve never been that into history. I guess I never
  thought about getting the other side of the story,” he conceded.<br />
  <br />
  “Well, don’t just take <i>my</i> word for it,” Marcus said quickly, sensing an
  opportunity. “You should do your own research. You might be surprised by what
  you find. Bottom line, though, the world is in desperate need of
  <i>real</i> heroes and warriors who’ll fight for what’s right.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth sighed, sagging down in his chair, holding his drink between his knees.
  “I dunno, man. You’re right that the world’s fucked, but it feels like you’re
  just getting your hopes up.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned back and smiled. “Look around. You just see a couple of guys
  talking in a bar, right? But don’t underestimate that. The Nazi Party in
  Germany started out as a bunch of passionate guys in a beer hall in Munich,
  and only ten years later they united their country, then they created one of
  the greatest war machines to ever exist. The only reason Germany lost was
  because they were badly outnumbered. Now it it’s starting again, here, in the
  United States, the most powerful country in the world, and this time, we have
  parahumans that level the—”<br />
  <br />
  “There you are, ranting about history <i>again,”</i> Spencer interrupted as he
  walked up from behind Marcus, putting his hands on Marcus’s shoulders and
  shooting a smile at Seth. “I swear, when we’re not drinkin’ or kickin’ Chink
  ass, this nerd’s got his head stuck in some old history book. He’ll talk your
  ear off if you’re not careful.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tilted his head far back to see Spencer. “Did you lose already?”<br />
  <br />
  “Nah, just wanted a smoke break. Liza’ll tan my hide if I light up in here.
  Wanna come with?” Spencer asked, already rummaging for the pack in his jacket
  pockets.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus cocked his head, considering. Seth didn’t smoke, so he wouldn’t be
  joining them, but it would probably be best to let Seth stew on Marcus’s words
  for a bit anyway. “Eh, sure. I could go for one.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus got up and followed Spencer out the door. Rudy and Liza didn’t
  appreciate people smoking out front—both of them were health nuts that hated
  secondhand smoke—so they’d set up a semi-enclosed little stoop in the side
  alley for smokers, with an overhang to ward away the rain and a pair of
  standing ashtrays.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer lit up a cig, and offered Marcus one with the lighter.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus lit his own, and took a lazy drag. Spencer didn’t buy the best
  cigarettes, but at least he avoided the cheapest shit available.<br />
  <br />
  Taking another drag, Marcus tried his best to savor the rich smoke despite the
  chilly night air. He was just about to take another pull when he heard a loud
  <i>thump</i> from nearby, making him cough in surprise.<br />
  <br />
  There was a shuffling sound in the alley, down on the side with the dead end.
  Someone was there the whole time? Marcus peered into the darkness, but it was
  almost impossible to see beyond the cone of wan, yellow light cast by the
  single bulb installed in the overhang. Marcus saw the guy in the shadows
  first, and lightly slapped Spencer’s shoulder, pointing his friend towards the
  newcomer. It was a guy in a hoodie.<br />
  <br />
  "The fuck d’you want?" Spencer asked, a bit muffled from the cigarette he held
  in his lips.<br />
  <br />
  "Are you two Empire Eighty-Eight?” the hooded man asked tersely. He was
  fidgeting and trembling uncontrollably, which Marcus immediately pegged as
  drug withdrawal. As the man stepped closer to the light, Marcus could see he
  had that unmistakable hungry look to him, but he was also wearing Empire
  colors.<br />
  <br />
  That gave Marcus pause, but his confusion resolved as quickly as it had
  arisen. This dude was clearly one of the Merchant’s degenerates, probably
  trying to pick a fight or dress up as one of them and steal some drugs or
  something. The dumbass had picked the <i>worst</i> possible place to do it,
  though.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus and Spencer exchanged a skeptical look before refocusing on the
  junkie.<br />
  <br />
  "Yeah, we’re Empire—but just coming right up and asking, that’s a first," said
  Spencer, smiling humorlessly. "But this ain’t a fuckin’ charity. We don’t give
  freebies to losers on the street just ‘cause they’re white. Fuck off.”<br />
  <br />
  The hoodie guy said nothing, his gaze hawkish and intense. Marcus felt his
  stomach tense at the creepy look in the hooded man’s eyes. He moved closer,
  striding right towards them.<br />
  <br />
  Was this guy for <i>real?</i> He must have been jonesing <i>hard</i> to think
  taking on two-on-one odds was a good idea, even without the gun.<br />
  <br />
  “You asked for it, motherfucker,” Spencer snarled, reaching into his jacket
  and pulling out his huge Ruger Blackhawk revolver. The dark gray metal made it
  almost impossible to see in the dark, but the menacing shape of Spencer’s
  beloved .357 magnum would be unmistakable, even to a junkie.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus didn’t even have time to register what the hooded man was doing when
  his left hand slapped the gun out of Spencer’s grip before he could even cock
  the hammer. In nearly the same instant, the hooded man’s right hand seized
  Spencer by the neck, then he kicked Marcus in the gut with a visceral
  <i>crunch</i> that radiated through Marcus’s whole body. Pain exploded in his
  midsection as he was lifted off his feet by the force of the blow, his back
  slamming into the concrete ashtray and sending him spinning into the
  ground.<br />
  <br />
  After a moment of disorientation, with blinding stars dancing in Marcus’s
  vision, the pain truly hit in full, and he couldn’t even <i>breathe</i>. It
  felt like he’d been broken in <i>half</i>. His stomach and back radiated with
  pure, overwhelming agony, and he curled up on his side, his beers and
  hamburger coming back up, the bitter acid and alcohol burning his throat and
  sinuses.<br />
  <br />
  After the brief convulsion of vomiting ended, Marcus struggled to take the
  smallest of breaths. He blinked the stars out of his streaming eyes only to
  watch as the guy in the hoodie—<i>the unmasked cape, </i>he realized—lifted
  Spencer off his feet by the neck.<br />
  <br />
  The parahuman didn’t even flinch as Spencer flailed and struggled, punching
  his face and clawing at his icy blue eyes. Then, the parahuman’s arms
  <i>transformed</i> somehow, sprouting into a mass of dark, jagged cables that
  stabbed into Spencer’s body, dragging him into the monster whose entire upper
  body split apart into a flurry of countless lashing blades.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer was <i>shredded</i>.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer’s clothes were ripped away and his body burst open like an overfilled
  grocery bag, blood and viscera splattering out of his dismembered body in
  unbelievable quantities. A moment later, the entrails were drawn into the
  monster’s body like food getting sucked down into a blender. Marcus saw a
  pale, mauled section of Spencer’s torso briefly surface from the seething
  mass, the meat and skin stretching obscenely as it was torn away from the
  bloody ribs, and a moment later the dripping, red segment of ribcage was
  crushed back down into the mass of fanged tentacles.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus would have vomited again from sheer <i>terror</i> if he’d had the
  capacity to, but for the moment all he could do was try and fail to breathe.
  Where his vision wasn’t blurry from tears, there was blackness fading in
  around the edges, whether from lack of air or oncoming shock from his
  injury.<br />
  <br />
  There were no thoughts of calling for help or fighting back. Marcus only felt
  bone-deep agony and overwhelming, electrifying fear. The need to be somewhere,
  <i>anywhere</i> else paradoxically froze him in place, as if his body had
  overridden his brain and was trying to hide in plain sight or offer abject
  surrender. Spencer had just <i>died, </i>it was unbelievable, it didn’t make
  any <i>sense,</i> this place was supposed to be <i>safe</i>—but Marcus was
  certain that he was next.<br />
  <br />
  The monster was resolving into a humanoid shape again. The thing compressed
  itself, crunching down and ejecting spurts of blood and chunks of gore like a
  squeezed sponge as it shrank down to the size and shape of a human again.
  Marcus felt the hot wetness splatter over him, but didn’t dare blink or look
  away.<br />
  <br />
  In moments, the tentacled thing had molded back together like clay and changed
  color to become the hooded figure once more, clothes and all. It was
  spotlessly clean despite standing in a huge, spreading pool of blood and bits
  of Spencer that cascaded down the short steps and into the alley beyond.<br />
  <br />
  “Damn,” said the monster wearing human skin. “All that and I’m still
  hungry.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus could hardly believe his own ears. The thing sounded mildly
  disappointed, almost <i>bored,</i> like he’d gotten the wrong order at a
  drive-thru.<br />
  <br />
  He killed Spencer and <i>that</i> was all he had to say?<br />
  <br />
  That spark of rage was what finally broke Marcus free from the paralysis of
  terror.<br />
  <br />
  He couldn’t move much, but he saw where Spencer’s Ruger had clattered against
  the wall and fallen nearby. With a desperate adrenaline-fueled lunge that
  ignited the pain in his back, Marcus grabbed the gun and aimed—<br />
  <br />
  There was a blur of motion, a tight feeling in his arm and shoulder. His arm
  moved <i>wrongly,</i> the angles not matching.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus saw his right forearm falling in four pieces from the bloody stump of
  his elbow. Blood fountained from the stump, the warm wetness spreading over
  his shirt. It just felt numb.<br />
  <br />
  looking up, Marcus saw that the monster had transformed its fingers into long,
  thin, scythe-like claws that were almost hypnotic in the effortless,
  quicksilver way they moved, like the swaying of a cobra about to strike. He
  looked away from the claws, and met the thing’s pale, dead eyes. There was no
  anger, no regret, no humanity, just <i>hunger</i>. The thing didn’t even care
  at all that Marcus was a human being, he realized in an instant of
  understanding. It just saw Marcus as an acceptable target.<br />
  <br />
  Then the pain hit in earnest, a searing fire in Marcus’s shoulder and arm. He
  let out what little breath he’d had left in a shuddering moan as he clutched
  the stump close to his chest.<br />
  <br />
  No. No. No. <i>No</i>. This couldn’t be happening. Not here. He had to get
  away...<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tried to move, but he couldn’t. He was too weak. He hurt so, so much,
  he was so tired. All he wanted was to go to sleep, and not have to deal with
  this pain anymore. He wanted to go to sleep and wake up in bed back home, back
  with his family.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus squeezed his eyes shut, tears spilling out. He remembered all the
  stupid arguments he had with his family, how much they begged him to stay home
  and not join the Empire.<br />
  <br />
  <i>I’m sorry, Mom. I’m sorry, Cass.</i><br />
  <br />
  The last thing Marcus felt besides the pain and regret was the sensation of
  being lifted up off the ground.<br />
  <br />
  <b
    >A/N <br />
    Still with me after this chapter? Good. I was really nervous about this one,
    for obvious reasons. Humanizing Nazis and depicting their propaganda is
    always a perilous thing, although it is vitally important to the story to do
    so, for reasons that will become clear later. Needless to say, the opinions
    of the characters do not reflect the author’s, yadda yadda. Marcus is
    supposed to come off as a jumped-up know-nothing wehraboo and a hypocrite,
    but still just a scared, misguided teen underneath. I hope that came
    through.<br />
    <br />
    In other news, I have launched a new contest! It can be found under the
    Apocrypha thread. I can announce here that two prizes have been claimed thus
    far—congratulations again to TheLastOne, who won a bespoke chapter and
    requested a Regent interlude (timing TBD). I must also congratulate the new
    winner, InfiniteTangent, whose correct answer has won everyone a bonus
    chapter coming out this upcoming Tuesday. Thanks to everyone who
    participated! Your guesses are extremely valuable to me, for gauging my

  <b>Infection 2.M</b><br />
  <br />
  Marcus lounged in the Eagle’s Nest, slowly sinking into one of the bar’s
  comfortable leather couches. He was nursing his second tall glass of beer that
  night, mindful not to let the pleasant buzz muddle his thoughts. He wanted his
  mind to stay relatively sharp, but also keep the atmosphere relaxed. Marcus
  was admittedly a lightweight, in more ways than one, and it didn’t take much
  alcohol to get a good buzz going—unlike his best friend Spencer, who sat in a
  matching armchair to his left.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer charitably described himself as ‘husky,’ in stark contrast to Marcus,
  and as a result Spencer could pound away drinks all night long and barely show
  it. He was currently demolishing a fourth beer. That was fine, since he wasn’t
  here to do the talking anyway. Spencer was around more to provide Marcus moral
  support and, admittedly, to complement him with a more normal and less serious
  side of things. It had been Spencer’s idea to invite the third member of their
  little group.<br />
  <br />
  On Marcus’s right sat Seth, the younger brother of an old high school friend
  of Spencer’s. Seth might have been okay with drinking alongside Spencer and
  Marcus—at least partly because he couldn’t get easy access to booze anywhere
  else—but he wasn’t a member of the Empire Eighty-Eight like Spencer and Marcus
  were. Marcus hoped to change that tonight. He had been noticed for his budding
  talent at changing minds, having brought two other members into the Empire in
  just six months, and adding a third would help him move up in the
  organization.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tended to prefer the deep and serious approach to recruitment, but
  Spencer was good at just making friends. He often reminded Marcus of a dog, in
  both good and bad ways. Spencer was friendly, silly, and a bit too fond of
  food, but he was brave and loyal when it counted the most. Marcus couldn’t
  have asked for a better friend, or a better partner in crime to try winning
  over hearts and minds. Spencer could handle the heart, while Marcus would
  target the mind.<br />
  <br />
  Seth had started out nervous when he’d entered the bar, but with the help of
  Spencer’s happy-go-lucky teasing and antics, he’d mellowed out considerably.
  That was good—it would make the next part easier.<br />
  <br />
  “What’s with the dopey smile?” Spencer asked Marcus.<br />
  <br />
  “Just thinkin’ about days gone by. You know. High school. How glad I am to put
  that shit behind me,” said Marcus, smirking at Seth before taking another sip
  of beer.<br />
  <br />
  “Yeah, man. Ancient history,” Seth responded with heavy irony, conveniently
  ignoring that he was 17 and still a senior at Winslow High.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer snorted. “Oh, fuck off with your <i>ancient history</i>. If it weren’t
  for us vouching for you, Liza would have tossed you out on your ass for
  showing up with that two-bit fake I.D.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth gestured at Marcus. “He’s only one grade ahead of me, why aren’t you
  getting on <i>his</i> case?”<br />
  <br />
  “It’s not about drinking age, it’s about who you <i>know</i>. Marcus and I are
  members of the club. You’re just our guest,” Spencer said sagely.<br />
  <br />
  “Come on, Spence,” Marcus gently chided. “He’s just here to relax and have a
  good time. This isn’t a members-only bar.”<br />
  <br />
  Spencer scoffed. “Like hell it isn’t! Look around, do you see
  <i>anyone</i> who’s not white?”<br />
  <br />
  “It’s more than just that. If all they did was keep out Merchants and homeless
  trash, that would be kind of a low bar,” Marcus pointed out.<br />
  <br />
  “Pun intended, right? You get weird when you drink, I ever tell you that? All
  serious and philly-<i>philosophical</i>. It’s fuckin’... nerdy as shit.”
  Spencer said, stumbling a bit over his words.<br />
  <br />
  “Whereas <i>you</i> get all tongue-tied,” Marcus deadpanned.<br />
  <br />
  “I’ll have you know I’m fluent in sign language too, jackass.” said Spencer,
  flipping Marcus the bird and then launching into an elaborate pantomime with a
  lot of pointing and unintelligible arm-chopping motions.<br />
  <br />
  “The hell are you even doing?” Seth laughed.<br />
  <br />
  “Lettin’ Marcus know he’s a sad little stick-in-the-mud.” said Spencer,
  stopping his wild gestures.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shrugged. Spencer’s teasing had long since stopped making him feel
  offended, not when he knew Spencer wasn’t really serious and tried to insult
  just about everyone he thought he could get away with.<br />
  <br />
  “Come on, you fuckin’ <i>lump</i>. Don’t you at least wanna play pool or
  something?” Spencer wheedled. He could be surprisingly shrewish for a guy with
  a beer belly and deep baritone voice.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus rolled his eyes. “Even <i>sober</i> you couldn’t hit the broad side of
  a barn, much less a billiard ball. Maybe try your luck with Landon over there,
  he looks like he can barely stand. If you can beat him, get back to me.”<br />
  <br />
  Spencer stood up and walked off, muttering. “I dunno why I hang around with
  such a stuck-up little toothpick.”<br />
  <br />
  Chuckling at his friend, Marcus settled back, relaxing. He let the sounds of
  the room wash over him, the charging beat of the rock music playing at medium
  volume in the background, the murmur of the crowd, the clink of glasses and
  silverware. He loved relaxing at the Eagle’s Nest. It was a safe haven full of
  simple pleasures, a stress-free environment compared to the howling goddamn
  insanity that was Brockton Bay.<br />
  <br />
  Seth, however, was fidgeting and seemed quite restless. His fear at being
  busted for underage drinking had evaporated, but he still looked like he
  didn’t quite know what to do with himself in this place where he stuck out
  like a sore thumb. He was the only one in the whole bar with shoulder-length
  brown hair, everyone else was either a natural or dyed blonde like Marcus, or
  a skinhead like Spencer.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus waited patiently. The topic of the Empire’s ideology was going to come
  up eventually. People didn’t listen when you tried to shove your worldview
  down their throats, they just got defensive and shut down, he knew that much
  from bitter experience with his mom and sister. If you just left the door open
  and answered their questions, though, they’d be a lot more receptive to what
  you had to say.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus’s gaze fell on the elaborately wrought iron eagle mounted in the corner
  near the ceiling, holding the corners of two flags in its claws. One was the
  Imperial German war ensign, the other an Iron Cross on a black background. It
  made Marcus feel a warm flush of pride.<br />
  <br />
  “Hey, Marcus. What are you thinking about?” Seth finally asked.<br />
  <br />
  “Just appreciating the vexillolography,” Marcus said, nodding at the flag.<br />
  <br />
  “Gesundheit,” said Seth, raising an eyebrow.<br />
  <br />
  “It means the art of the flags. There’s a lot of meaning behind every element
  in the colors and symbols.” Marcus said.<br />
  <br />
  “I’ve been meaning to ask you about that—not the flag, I mean, but all the
  Nazi stuff. Like, I know the Nazis had some cool shit and all, but I don’t get
  why you and your, uh, <i>friends</i> are all gung-ho about them. You’re not
  even German.” Seth pointed out.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus chuckled, leaning forward. “You know, I’m <i>so</i> glad you asked
  about the <i>good news...!”</i> he said with mock brightness, doing his best
  door-knocking evangelist impression.<br />
  <br />
  “Oh, God, spare me the sales pitch. Forget I said anything!” said Seth,
  covering his eyes.<br />
  <br />
  They both laughed together, in that un-self-conscious way that only partially
  inebriated people could manage.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned back, sighing after the laughing fit passed. “Seriously, though,
  dude. I won’t push, but do you really want to know?”<br />
  <br />
  Seth shrugged. “I mean, kinda? I’ve always been more interested in the biker
  and metalhead scenes, but if you hang out around those long enough, you pick
  up a thing or two. I don’t really get it, though. I mean, don’t get me wrong,
  I hate those ABB motherfuckers, but I don’t get the jump from that to, like,
  full-on Nazis.”<br />
  <br />
  “I think you understand more than you think,” Marcus said, holding up a hand.
  “Maybe it’ll help to give you an example. For me, I started coming around when
  I began noticing that something was really wrong with the world.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth scoffed. “There’s a <i>lot</i> wrong with the world. There’s wars and
  Endbringers and the Water Crisis and all that shit.”<br />
  <br />
  “I mean besides the obvious. There’s something rotten with
  <i>normal</i> people, the way they think and act. You know, just culture in
  general,” Marcus pressed, waving a finger in a circle as if to encompass the
  whole world. “Didn’t everything seem so much more hopeful when we were kids? I
  mean, we were both born after the Golden Age of Superheroes ended, but things
  weren’t so bad on the surface. Behemoth came around before I could really
  remember, but people didn’t really know what that had <i>meant</i> yet. Do you
  remember when Jörmungandr first appeared?”<br />
  <br />
  “Who?” asked Seth, his brow knitting in confusion.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned in closer, quietly listing off the names of the beast.
  “Jörmungandr. The Second. The Serpent. <i>Leviathan</i>.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus saw a spark of interest in Seth’s eyes, and knew he’d hit pay dirt, a
  true connection. The truth that can only be uncovered by shared experience.<br />
  <br />
  “I do,” Seth said, his voice coming out hushed, subconsciously mirroring
  Marcus’ own serious tone. “What’s that got to do with Nazis, though?”<br />
  <br />
  <i>“Everything,”</i> Marcus said, spreading his arms wide. “It’s all
  connected. I’ll tell you the story, if you like.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth still looked a little skeptical, but he’d picked up on Marcus’s serious
  mood. He nodded solemnly.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus mentally girded himself, disciplining his thoughts into order. It was
  hard being a recruiter. He had to bare his soul and confront some heavy shit,
  the dark truths that everyone knew but preferred to ignore. And he had to do
  all that with total conviction and confidence, without flinching away from the
  uncomfortable parts. It opened Marcus up to mockery or attacks or joking
  deflections, but it was necessary. People could sense insincerity a mile away.
  He had to make himself vulnerable to be believed, then build that connection
  up into something strong.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus took a deep breath, and began his story.<br />
  <br />
  “One of my earliest memories was watching TV with my big sister, some cartoon
  or something. Suddenly, the movie cut out, and it started showing the news, so
  my sister tried changing the channel, but it was all the same thing on
  <i>every</i> channel, talking about Jörmungandr appearing for the first time.
  I was just a little kid, I didn’t know what was going on, and Cass wouldn’t
  tell me, so I called out to Mom. She came into the living room, and then she
  just <i>froze</i>. I don’t really remember what the news was saying, but I’ll
  never forget the look on her face. How she went all still and white. Seeing my
  mom, standing there like a statue, just... I could tell she was rooted by pure
  <i>fear, </i>and it scared me more than anything I’d ever seen in my life.
  Then she grabbed both of us, hugging us so hard it <i>hurt,</i> and even
  though she couldn’t stop <i>crying,</i> she still didn’t look away from the
  TV, not even once. We didn’t understand what happened, but it was mom’s
  reaction that made it <i>real</i>. After that, I saw the despair everywhere,
  but I didn’t understand it, what that really <i>meant</i> for the world, not
  until years later.”<br />
  <br />
  As Marcus spoke, he felt chills racing down his body, goosebumps rippling out
  over his arms at reliving the memory.<br />
  <br />
  “Are you talking about Leviathan being the reason for the boat graveyard, and
  the city’s economy getting fucked up?” Seth asked as Marcus took a drink to
  soothe his suddenly dry throat.<br />
  <br />
  “That’s only a tiny part of it. <i>Everything</i> went downhill from there,
  <i>everywhere</i>. You and I, our generation, we could feel it even when we
  were kids, and growing up it only got worse. Think about it—when Jörmungandr
  sank Kyushu, that’s when all the immigrants started flooding in. Not just in
  Brockton Bay with the ABB turning the place into a shithole, there’s
  <i>millions</i> of refugees all over, and it’s only going to get a thousand
  times worse in a few years. So what’s <i>wrong</i> with people? They’re all
  <i>terrified, </i>but they’re pretending that they aren’t. People are too busy
  with sports or celebrities or drugs or whatever pointless, petty bullshit they
  use to distract themselves from thinking.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth nodded. “Oh yeah. It’s all total bullshit, we can agree on that part.
  People would rather have their comfortable lies instead of the hard truth. I
  don’t sign on to all the race stuff, though.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus felt his cheeks flush a little with his frustration, and hoped it
  didn’t show. The pitch had started well, but now it felt like he was losing
  Seth, so he decided to go for one of his trump cards. “About the race stuff, I
  get it. I do. We’ve been taught from birth it’s bad. Kumbaya and give peace a
  chance and all that shit the mass media pushes to keep everyone in line. But
  you can just as easily say <i>fighting</i> is bad. There’s no room for that
  out in the <i>real</i> world, where things like fighting and racism are
  sometimes <i>necessary</i>. I’ve heard it explained this way, and it really
  stuck with me: think of the world like a sinking ship. Your country—as in,
  your culture, that’s the lifeboat.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth raised a skeptical eyebrow. “So you’re saying we’re like the
  <i>Titanic</i>, and the Jews are like the iceberg or something?”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shook his head, resisting the urge to call out Seth’s stupidity. “No,
  not at all. What I mean is, the ship’s like the world, and it’s already
  sinking, there’s nothing we can do to stop it now. Think of white culture as
  the last lifeboat. Everyone knows it’s their best chance, so everyone’s
  flocking to it. But if too many people try to climb on the lifeboat, they’ll
  sink the whole thing for everyone. Sure, you can give up your spot on the boat
  if you want to be <i>nice</i> or whatever, but then you’re just, y’know,
  adding to the problem, because the guy you let on wants to bring
  <i>his</i> family, <i>his</i> friends, and now suddenly everyone’s fighting
  each other instead of defending the boat. The lifeboat sinks, everyone dies,
  and <i>nobody</i> is better off just because you did the ‘nice’ thing. In
  order to survive, we have to <i>fight,</i> and to fight we have to be united
  by something stronger. A shared culture, shared blood. I know no one
  <i>else</i> is going to fight for me, all the other races only ever stick up
  for themselves. So why shouldn’t we?”<br />
  <br />
  Seth shrugged helplessly. “Look, I’m all for protecting my own culture. I
  don’t have any problem with that, and I’m proud to be white too. It’s a good
  thing, right? I don’t know what else to tell you, though. All the Asians can
  fuck right off back to where they came from, but I don’t see the point of
  being so hung up over the blacks and gays and Jews. It just seems... kinda
  pointless, you know?”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shook his head. “I’m sorry if it’s hard to accept, but including blacks
  and gays and whatever else is a luxury we just can’t <i>afford</i>. Black
  people and their problems are a liability in this fight, you don’t have to
  hate them, but that’s just a <i>fact</i>. They’re less than 13% of the
  population, but they commit the majority of the crimes. White people have an
  IQ of 100 and black people have an IQ of 80. That’s just the truth, and it
  won’t change for anybody’s politically correct <i>bullshit</i>. It’s just
  nature, and it’s nobody’s <i>fault,</i> but whose fault it is doesn’t matter.
  What matters is <i>survival,</i> and I’m sorry, but you’re not gonna survive
  if you rely on black people or gay people. Just look at Africa. Just look at
  the Roman Empire.”<br />
  <br />
  “No, no, no. I get that part, but I just... does it <i>have</i> to be all
  swastikas and Sieg heils and shit? I mean, no offense, but like, it seems like
  you’re going too far in the other direction. This isn’t Germany in the ‘30s.
  It feels like you’re all trying to dress up for Halloween or something,” said
  Seth, looking pointedly at the guy at the bar with a swastika tattoo on his
  neck.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus waved his hand dismissively. “What, the symbols and all that? It’s just
  ways for people to rebel, or support their favorite capes in the Empire. The
  symbolism is our way of saying <i>fuck the system. </i>It’s about reclaiming
  our heritage from all the lies and bullshit, and some people...” Marcus
  gestured at Spencer’s iron cross-decorated jacket before continuing, “...Just
  like that it drives the fuckers nuts.”<br />
  <br />
  “Okay, that’s fine, I guess, I’m not against free speech or whatever.” Seth
  said sulkily, taking a swig of his beer.<br />
  <br />
  Nodding equably, Marcus tried to steer things back on track. “Letting people
  just do their own thing is okay when things are good, but we’ve
  <i>tried</i> mashing people from different cultures together, and it just
  <i>doesn’t work</i>. We need to try something else.”<br />
  <br />
  “Man, come on. It’s not like the Nazis had the best track record either, they
  did some pretty fucked up shit too.” said Seth, chuckling dryly. “Like, even
  if all you said was true, killing all the Jews or whatever just doesn’t seem
  like it would <i>help</i> anything, just make things even worse.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus felt a flash of indignation at the jibe. It was genuinely disturbing to
  hear all the old fallacies and talking points trotted out robotically, almost
  verbatim. The sheep <i>always</i> brought it around to the Holocaust, every
  single time.<br />
  <br />
  “History is written by the victors, you know that. You’ve got to think for
  <i>yourself,”</i> Marcus said, the words coming out more snidely than he
  intended. He took a quick, calming breath, and continued in a more mellow
  tone, “Allied propaganda only gets a pass because they won in the end.
  Nowadays, people think of fascism like this one-sided, cartoonish thing, just
  bad guys for Indiana Jones and Uncle Sam to punch. When normal people think of
  Nazis, they think of black-and-white newsreels with Hitler speaking
  passionately in German—but haven’t you ever noticed they never include any
  subtitles? God forbid people hear a translation, or else they might end up
  <i>agreeing</i> with him.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth frowned. “I mean, I’ve never been that into history. I guess I never
  thought about getting the other side of the story,” he conceded.<br />
  <br />
  “Well, don’t just take <i>my</i> word for it,” Marcus said quickly, sensing an
  opportunity. “You should do your own research. You might be surprised by what
  you find. Bottom line, though, the world is in desperate need of
  <i>real</i> heroes and warriors who’ll fight for what’s right.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth sighed, sagging down in his chair, holding his drink between his knees.
  “I dunno, man. You’re right that the world’s fucked, but it feels like you’re
  just getting your hopes up.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned back and smiled. “Look around. You just see a couple of guys
  talking in a bar, right? But don’t underestimate that. The Nazi Party in
  Germany started out as a bunch of passionate guys in a beer hall in Munich,
  and only ten years later they united their country, then they created one of
  the greatest war machines to ever exist. The only reason Germany lost was
  because they were badly outnumbered. Now it it’s starting again, here, in the
  United States, the most powerful country in the world, and this time, we have
  parahumans that level the—”<br />
  <br />
  “There you are, ranting about history <i>again,”</i> Spencer interrupted as he
  walked up from behind Marcus, putting his hands on Marcus’s shoulders and
  shooting a smile at Seth. “I swear, when we’re not drinkin’ or kickin’ Chink
  ass, this nerd’s got his head stuck in some old history book. He’ll talk your
  ear off if you’re not careful.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tilted his head far back to see Spencer. “Did you lose already?”<br />
  <br />
  “Nah, just wanted a smoke break. Liza’ll tan my hide if I light up in here.
  Wanna come with?” Spencer asked, already rummaging for the pack in his jacket
  pockets.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus cocked his head, considering. Seth didn’t smoke, so he wouldn’t be
  joining them, but it would probably be best to let Seth stew on Marcus’s words
  for a bit anyway. “Eh, sure. I could go for one.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus got up and followed Spencer out the door. Rudy and Liza didn’t
  appreciate people smoking out front—both of them were health nuts that hated
  secondhand smoke—so they’d set up a semi-enclosed little stoop in the side
  alley for smokers, with an overhang to ward away the rain and a pair of
  standing ashtrays.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer lit up a cig, and offered Marcus one with the lighter.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus lit his own, and took a lazy drag. Spencer didn’t buy the best
  cigarettes, but at least he avoided the cheapest shit available.<br />
  <br />
  Taking another drag, Marcus tried his best to savor the rich smoke despite the
  chilly night air. He was just about to take another pull when he heard a loud
  <i>thump</i> from nearby, making him cough in surprise.<br />
  <br />
  There was a shuffling sound in the alley, down on the side with the dead end.
  Someone was there the whole time? Marcus peered into the darkness, but it was
  almost impossible to see beyond the cone of wan, yellow light cast by the
  single bulb installed in the overhang. Marcus saw the guy in the shadows
  first, and lightly slapped Spencer’s shoulder, pointing his friend towards the
  newcomer. It was a guy in a hoodie.<br />
  <br />
  "The fuck d’you want?" Spencer asked, a bit muffled from the cigarette he held
  in his lips.<br />
  <br />
  "Are you two Empire Eighty-Eight?” the hooded man asked tersely. He was
  fidgeting and trembling uncontrollably, which Marcus immediately pegged as
  drug withdrawal. As the man stepped closer to the light, Marcus could see he
  had that unmistakable hungry look to him, but he was also wearing Empire
  colors.<br />
  <br />
  That gave Marcus pause, but his confusion resolved as quickly as it had
  arisen. This dude was clearly one of the Merchant’s degenerates, probably
  trying to pick a fight or dress up as one of them and steal some drugs or
  something. The dumbass had picked the <i>worst</i> possible place to do it,
  though.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus and Spencer exchanged a skeptical look before refocusing on the
  junkie.<br />
  <br />
  "Yeah, we’re Empire—but just coming right up and asking, that’s a first," said
  Spencer, smiling humorlessly. "But this ain’t a fuckin’ charity. We don’t give
  freebies to losers on the street just ‘cause they’re white. Fuck off.”<br />
  <br />
  The hoodie guy said nothing, his gaze hawkish and intense. Marcus felt his
  stomach tense at the creepy look in the hooded man’s eyes. He moved closer,
  striding right towards them.<br />
  <br />
  Was this guy for <i>real?</i> He must have been jonesing <i>hard</i> to think
  taking on two-on-one odds was a good idea, even without the gun.<br />
  <br />
  “You asked for it, motherfucker,” Spencer snarled, reaching into his jacket
  and pulling out his huge Ruger Blackhawk revolver. The dark gray metal made it
  almost impossible to see in the dark, but the menacing shape of Spencer’s
  beloved .357 magnum would be unmistakable, even to a junkie.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus didn’t even have time to register what the hooded man was doing when
  his left hand slapped the gun out of Spencer’s grip before he could even cock
  the hammer. In nearly the same instant, the hooded man’s right hand seized
  Spencer by the neck, then he kicked Marcus in the gut with a visceral
  <i>crunch</i> that radiated through Marcus’s whole body. Pain exploded in his
  midsection as he was lifted off his feet by the force of the blow, his back
  slamming into the concrete ashtray and sending him spinning into the
  ground.<br />
  <br />
  After a moment of disorientation, with blinding stars dancing in Marcus’s
  vision, the pain truly hit in full, and he couldn’t even <i>breathe</i>. It
  felt like he’d been broken in <i>half</i>. His stomach and back radiated with
  pure, overwhelming agony, and he curled up on his side, his beers and
  hamburger coming back up, the bitter acid and alcohol burning his throat and
  sinuses.<br />
  <br />
  After the brief convulsion of vomiting ended, Marcus struggled to take the
  smallest of breaths. He blinked the stars out of his streaming eyes only to
  watch as the guy in the hoodie—<i>the unmasked cape, </i>he realized—lifted
  Spencer off his feet by the neck.<br />
  <br />
  The parahuman didn’t even flinch as Spencer flailed and struggled, punching
  his face and clawing at his icy blue eyes. Then, the parahuman’s arms
  <i>transformed</i> somehow, sprouting into a mass of dark, jagged cables that
  stabbed into Spencer’s body, dragging him into the monster whose entire upper
  body split apart into a flurry of countless lashing blades.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer was <i>shredded</i>.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer’s clothes were ripped away and his body burst open like an overfilled
  grocery bag, blood and viscera splattering out of his dismembered body in
  unbelievable quantities. A moment later, the entrails were drawn into the
  monster’s body like food getting sucked down into a blender. Marcus saw a
  pale, mauled section of Spencer’s torso briefly surface from the seething
  mass, the meat and skin stretching obscenely as it was torn away from the
  bloody ribs, and a moment later the dripping, red segment of ribcage was
  crushed back down into the mass of fanged tentacles.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus would have vomited again from sheer <i>terror</i> if he’d had the
  capacity to, but for the moment all he could do was try and fail to breathe.
  Where his vision wasn’t blurry from tears, there was blackness fading in
  around the edges, whether from lack of air or oncoming shock from his
  injury.<br />
  <br />
  There were no thoughts of calling for help or fighting back. Marcus only felt
  bone-deep agony and overwhelming, electrifying fear. The need to be somewhere,
  <i>anywhere</i> else paradoxically froze him in place, as if his body had
  overridden his brain and was trying to hide in plain sight or offer abject
  surrender. Spencer had just <i>died, </i>it was unbelievable, it didn’t make
  any <i>sense,</i> this place was supposed to be <i>safe</i>—but Marcus was
  certain that he was next.<br />
  <br />
  The monster was resolving into a humanoid shape again. The thing compressed
  itself, crunching down and ejecting spurts of blood and chunks of gore like a
  squeezed sponge as it shrank down to the size and shape of a human again.
  Marcus felt the hot wetness splatter over him, but didn’t dare blink or look
  away.<br />
  <br />
  In moments, the tentacled thing had molded back together like clay and changed
  color to become the hooded figure once more, clothes and all. It was
  spotlessly clean despite standing in a huge, spreading pool of blood and bits
  of Spencer that cascaded down the short steps and into the alley beyond.<br />
  <br />
  “Damn,” said the monster wearing human skin. “All that and I’m still
  hungry.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus could hardly believe his own ears. The thing sounded mildly
  disappointed, almost <i>bored,</i> like he’d gotten the wrong order at a
  drive-thru.<br />
  <br />
  He killed Spencer and <i>that</i> was all he had to say?<br />
  <br />
  That spark of rage was what finally broke Marcus free from the paralysis of
  terror.<br />
  <br />
  He couldn’t move much, but he saw where Spencer’s Ruger had clattered against
  the wall and fallen nearby. With a desperate adrenaline-fueled lunge that
  ignited the pain in his back, Marcus grabbed the gun and aimed—<br />
  <br />
  There was a blur of motion, a tight feeling in his arm and shoulder. His arm
  moved <i>wrongly,</i> the angles not matching.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus saw his right forearm falling in four pieces from the bloody stump of
  his elbow. Blood fountained from the stump, the warm wetness spreading over
  his shirt. It just felt numb.<br />
  <br />
  looking up, Marcus saw that the monster had transformed its fingers into long,
  thin, scythe-like claws that were almost hypnotic in the effortless,
  quicksilver way they moved, like the swaying of a cobra about to strike. He
  looked away from the claws, and met the thing’s pale, dead eyes. There was no
  anger, no regret, no humanity, just <i>hunger</i>. The thing didn’t even care
  at all that Marcus was a human being, he realized in an instant of
  understanding. It just saw Marcus as an acceptable target.<br />
  <br />
  Then the pain hit in earnest, a searing fire in Marcus’s shoulder and arm. He
  let out what little breath he’d had left in a shuddering moan as he clutched
  the stump close to his chest.<br />
  <br />
  No. No. No. <i>No</i>. This couldn’t be happening. Not here. He had to get
  away...<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tried to move, but he couldn’t. He was too weak. He hurt so, so much,
  he was so tired. All he wanted was to go to sleep, and not have to deal with
  this pain anymore. He wanted to go to sleep and wake up in bed back home, back
  with his family.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus squeezed his eyes shut, tears spilling out. He remembered all the
  stupid arguments he had with his family, how much they begged him to stay home
  and not join the Empire.<br />
  <br />
  <i>I’m sorry, Mom. I’m sorry, Cass.</i><br />
  <br />
  The last thing Marcus felt besides the pain and regret was the sensation of
  being lifted up off the ground.<br />
  <br />
  <b
    >A/N <br />
    Still with me after this chapter? Good. I was really nervous about this one,
    for obvious reasons. Humanizing Nazis and depicting their propaganda is
    always a perilous thing, although it is vitally important to the story to do
    so, for reasons that will become clear later. Needless to say, the opinions
    of the characters do not reflect the author’s, yadda yadda. Marcus is
    supposed to come off as a jumped-up know-nothing wehraboo and a hypocrite,
    but still just a scared, misguided teen underneath. I hope that came
    through.<br />
    <br />
    In other news, I have launched a new contest! It can be found under the
    Apocrypha thread. I can announce here that two prizes have been claimed thus
    far—congratulations again to TheLastOne, who won a bespoke chapter and
    requested a Regent interlude (timing TBD). I must also congratulate the new
    winner, InfiniteTangent, whose correct answer has won everyone a bonus
    chapter coming out this upcoming Tuesday. Thanks to everyone who

  <b>Infection 2.M</b><br />
  <br />
  Marcus lounged in the Eagle’s Nest, slowly sinking into one of the bar’s
  comfortable leather couches. He was nursing his second tall glass of beer that
  night, mindful not to let the pleasant buzz muddle his thoughts. He wanted his
  mind to stay relatively sharp, but also keep the atmosphere relaxed. Marcus
  was admittedly a lightweight, in more ways than one, and it didn’t take much
  alcohol to get a good buzz going—unlike his best friend Spencer, who sat in a
  matching armchair to his left.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer charitably described himself as ‘husky,’ in stark contrast to Marcus,
  and as a result Spencer could pound away drinks all night long and barely show
  it. He was currently demolishing a fourth beer. That was fine, since he wasn’t
  here to do the talking anyway. Spencer was around more to provide Marcus moral
  support and, admittedly, to complement him with a more normal and less serious
  side of things. It had been Spencer’s idea to invite the third member of their
  little group.<br />
  <br />
  On Marcus’s right sat Seth, the younger brother of an old high school friend
  of Spencer’s. Seth might have been okay with drinking alongside Spencer and
  Marcus—at least partly because he couldn’t get easy access to booze anywhere
  else—but he wasn’t a member of the Empire Eighty-Eight like Spencer and Marcus
  were. Marcus hoped to change that tonight. He had been noticed for his budding
  talent at changing minds, having brought two other members into the Empire in
  just six months, and adding a third would help him move up in the
  organization.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tended to prefer the deep and serious approach to recruitment, but
  Spencer was good at just making friends. He often reminded Marcus of a dog, in
  both good and bad ways. Spencer was friendly, silly, and a bit too fond of
  food, but he was brave and loyal when it counted the most. Marcus couldn’t
  have asked for a better friend, or a better partner in crime to try winning
  over hearts and minds. Spencer could handle the heart, while Marcus would
  target the mind.<br />
  <br />
  Seth had started out nervous when he’d entered the bar, but with the help of
  Spencer’s happy-go-lucky teasing and antics, he’d mellowed out considerably.
  That was good—it would make the next part easier.<br />
  <br />
  “What’s with the dopey smile?” Spencer asked Marcus.<br />
  <br />
  “Just thinkin’ about days gone by. You know. High school. How glad I am to put
  that shit behind me,” said Marcus, smirking at Seth before taking another sip
  of beer.<br />
  <br />
  “Yeah, man. Ancient history,” Seth responded with heavy irony, conveniently
  ignoring that he was 17 and still a senior at Winslow High.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer snorted. “Oh, fuck off with your <i>ancient history</i>. If it weren’t
  for us vouching for you, Liza would have tossed you out on your ass for
  showing up with that two-bit fake I.D.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth gestured at Marcus. “He’s only one grade ahead of me, why aren’t you
  getting on <i>his</i> case?”<br />
  <br />
  “It’s not about drinking age, it’s about who you <i>know</i>. Marcus and I are
  members of the club. You’re just our guest,” Spencer said sagely.<br />
  <br />
  “Come on, Spence,” Marcus gently chided. “He’s just here to relax and have a
  good time. This isn’t a members-only bar.”<br />
  <br />
  Spencer scoffed. “Like hell it isn’t! Look around, do you see
  <i>anyone</i> who’s not white?”<br />
  <br />
  “It’s more than just that. If all they did was keep out Merchants and homeless
  trash, that would be kind of a low bar,” Marcus pointed out.<br />
  <br />
  “Pun intended, right? You get weird when you drink, I ever tell you that? All
  serious and philly-<i>philosophical</i>. It’s fuckin’... nerdy as shit.”
  Spencer said, stumbling a bit over his words.<br />
  <br />
  “Whereas <i>you</i> get all tongue-tied,” Marcus deadpanned.<br />
  <br />
  “I’ll have you know I’m fluent in sign language too, jackass.” said Spencer,
  flipping Marcus the bird and then launching into an elaborate pantomime with a
  lot of pointing and unintelligible arm-chopping motions.<br />
  <br />
  “The hell are you even doing?” Seth laughed.<br />
  <br />
  “Lettin’ Marcus know he’s a sad little stick-in-the-mud.” said Spencer,
  stopping his wild gestures.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shrugged. Spencer’s teasing had long since stopped making him feel
  offended, not when he knew Spencer wasn’t really serious and tried to insult
  just about everyone he thought he could get away with.<br />
  <br />
  “Come on, you fuckin’ <i>lump</i>. Don’t you at least wanna play pool or
  something?” Spencer wheedled. He could be surprisingly shrewish for a guy with
  a beer belly and deep baritone voice.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus rolled his eyes. “Even <i>sober</i> you couldn’t hit the broad side of
  a barn, much less a billiard ball. Maybe try your luck with Landon over there,
  he looks like he can barely stand. If you can beat him, get back to me.”<br />
  <br />
  Spencer stood up and walked off, muttering. “I dunno why I hang around with
  such a stuck-up little toothpick.”<br />
  <br />
  Chuckling at his friend, Marcus settled back, relaxing. He let the sounds of
  the room wash over him, the charging beat of the rock music playing at medium
  volume in the background, the murmur of the crowd, the clink of glasses and
  silverware. He loved relaxing at the Eagle’s Nest. It was a safe haven full of
  simple pleasures, a stress-free environment compared to the howling goddamn
  insanity that was Brockton Bay.<br />
  <br />
  Seth, however, was fidgeting and seemed quite restless. His fear at being
  busted for underage drinking had evaporated, but he still looked like he
  didn’t quite know what to do with himself in this place where he stuck out
  like a sore thumb. He was the only one in the whole bar with shoulder-length
  brown hair, everyone else was either a natural or dyed blonde like Marcus, or
  a skinhead like Spencer.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus waited patiently. The topic of the Empire’s ideology was going to come
  up eventually. People didn’t listen when you tried to shove your worldview
  down their throats, they just got defensive and shut down, he knew that much
  from bitter experience with his mom and sister. If you just left the door open
  and answered their questions, though, they’d be a lot more receptive to what
  you had to say.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus’s gaze fell on the elaborately wrought iron eagle mounted in the corner
  near the ceiling, holding the corners of two flags in its claws. One was the
  Imperial German war ensign, the other an Iron Cross on a black background. It
  made Marcus feel a warm flush of pride.<br />
  <br />
  “Hey, Marcus. What are you thinking about?” Seth finally asked.<br />
  <br />
  “Just appreciating the vexillolography,” Marcus said, nodding at the flag.<br />
  <br />
  “Gesundheit,” said Seth, raising an eyebrow.<br />
  <br />
  “It means the art of the flags. There’s a lot of meaning behind every element
  in the colors and symbols.” Marcus said.<br />
  <br />
  “I’ve been meaning to ask you about that—not the flag, I mean, but all the
  Nazi stuff. Like, I know the Nazis had some cool shit and all, but I don’t get
  why you and your, uh, <i>friends</i> are all gung-ho about them. You’re not
  even German.” Seth pointed out.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus chuckled, leaning forward. “You know, I’m <i>so</i> glad you asked
  about the <i>good news...!”</i> he said with mock brightness, doing his best
  door-knocking evangelist impression.<br />
  <br />
  “Oh, God, spare me the sales pitch. Forget I said anything!” said Seth,
  covering his eyes.<br />
  <br />
  They both laughed together, in that un-self-conscious way that only partially
  inebriated people could manage.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned back, sighing after the laughing fit passed. “Seriously, though,
  dude. I won’t push, but do you really want to know?”<br />
  <br />
  Seth shrugged. “I mean, kinda? I’ve always been more interested in the biker
  and metalhead scenes, but if you hang out around those long enough, you pick
  up a thing or two. I don’t really get it, though. I mean, don’t get me wrong,
  I hate those ABB motherfuckers, but I don’t get the jump from that to, like,
  full-on Nazis.”<br />
  <br />
  “I think you understand more than you think,” Marcus said, holding up a hand.
  “Maybe it’ll help to give you an example. For me, I started coming around when
  I began noticing that something was really wrong with the world.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth scoffed. “There’s a <i>lot</i> wrong with the world. There’s wars and
  Endbringers and the Water Crisis and all that shit.”<br />
  <br />
  “I mean besides the obvious. There’s something rotten with
  <i>normal</i> people, the way they think and act. You know, just culture in
  general,” Marcus pressed, waving a finger in a circle as if to encompass the
  whole world. “Didn’t everything seem so much more hopeful when we were kids? I
  mean, we were both born after the Golden Age of Superheroes ended, but things
  weren’t so bad on the surface. Behemoth came around before I could really
  remember, but people didn’t really know what that had <i>meant</i> yet. Do you
  remember when Jörmungandr first appeared?”<br />
  <br />
  “Who?” asked Seth, his brow knitting in confusion.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned in closer, quietly listing off the names of the beast.
  “Jörmungandr. The Second. The Serpent. <i>Leviathan</i>.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus saw a spark of interest in Seth’s eyes, and knew he’d hit pay dirt, a
  true connection. The truth that can only be uncovered by shared experience.<br />
  <br />
  “I do,” Seth said, his voice coming out hushed, subconsciously mirroring
  Marcus’ own serious tone. “What’s that got to do with Nazis, though?”<br />
  <br />
  <i>“Everything,”</i> Marcus said, spreading his arms wide. “It’s all
  connected. I’ll tell you the story, if you like.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth still looked a little skeptical, but he’d picked up on Marcus’s serious
  mood. He nodded solemnly.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus mentally girded himself, disciplining his thoughts into order. It was
  hard being a recruiter. He had to bare his soul and confront some heavy shit,
  the dark truths that everyone knew but preferred to ignore. And he had to do
  all that with total conviction and confidence, without flinching away from the
  uncomfortable parts. It opened Marcus up to mockery or attacks or joking
  deflections, but it was necessary. People could sense insincerity a mile away.
  He had to make himself vulnerable to be believed, then build that connection
  up into something strong.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus took a deep breath, and began his story.<br />
  <br />
  “One of my earliest memories was watching TV with my big sister, some cartoon
  or something. Suddenly, the movie cut out, and it started showing the news, so
  my sister tried changing the channel, but it was all the same thing on
  <i>every</i> channel, talking about Jörmungandr appearing for the first time.
  I was just a little kid, I didn’t know what was going on, and Cass wouldn’t
  tell me, so I called out to Mom. She came into the living room, and then she
  just <i>froze</i>. I don’t really remember what the news was saying, but I’ll
  never forget the look on her face. How she went all still and white. Seeing my
  mom, standing there like a statue, just... I could tell she was rooted by pure
  <i>fear, </i>and it scared me more than anything I’d ever seen in my life.
  Then she grabbed both of us, hugging us so hard it <i>hurt,</i> and even
  though she couldn’t stop <i>crying,</i> she still didn’t look away from the
  TV, not even once. We didn’t understand what happened, but it was mom’s
  reaction that made it <i>real</i>. After that, I saw the despair everywhere,
  but I didn’t understand it, what that really <i>meant</i> for the world, not
  until years later.”<br />
  <br />
  As Marcus spoke, he felt chills racing down his body, goosebumps rippling out
  over his arms at reliving the memory.<br />
  <br />
  “Are you talking about Leviathan being the reason for the boat graveyard, and
  the city’s economy getting fucked up?” Seth asked as Marcus took a drink to
  soothe his suddenly dry throat.<br />
  <br />
  “That’s only a tiny part of it. <i>Everything</i> went downhill from there,
  <i>everywhere</i>. You and I, our generation, we could feel it even when we
  were kids, and growing up it only got worse. Think about it—when Jörmungandr
  sank Kyushu, that’s when all the immigrants started flooding in. Not just in
  Brockton Bay with the ABB turning the place into a shithole, there’s
  <i>millions</i> of refugees all over, and it’s only going to get a thousand
  times worse in a few years. So what’s <i>wrong</i> with people? They’re all
  <i>terrified, </i>but they’re pretending that they aren’t. People are too busy
  with sports or celebrities or drugs or whatever pointless, petty bullshit they
  use to distract themselves from thinking.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth nodded. “Oh yeah. It’s all total bullshit, we can agree on that part.
  People would rather have their comfortable lies instead of the hard truth. I
  don’t sign on to all the race stuff, though.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus felt his cheeks flush a little with his frustration, and hoped it
  didn’t show. The pitch had started well, but now it felt like he was losing
  Seth, so he decided to go for one of his trump cards. “About the race stuff, I
  get it. I do. We’ve been taught from birth it’s bad. Kumbaya and give peace a
  chance and all that shit the mass media pushes to keep everyone in line. But
  you can just as easily say <i>fighting</i> is bad. There’s no room for that
  out in the <i>real</i> world, where things like fighting and racism are
  sometimes <i>necessary</i>. I’ve heard it explained this way, and it really
  stuck with me: think of the world like a sinking ship. Your country—as in,
  your culture, that’s the lifeboat.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth raised a skeptical eyebrow. “So you’re saying we’re like the
  <i>Titanic</i>, and the Jews are like the iceberg or something?”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shook his head, resisting the urge to call out Seth’s stupidity. “No,
  not at all. What I mean is, the ship’s like the world, and it’s already
  sinking, there’s nothing we can do to stop it now. Think of white culture as
  the last lifeboat. Everyone knows it’s their best chance, so everyone’s
  flocking to it. But if too many people try to climb on the lifeboat, they’ll
  sink the whole thing for everyone. Sure, you can give up your spot on the boat
  if you want to be <i>nice</i> or whatever, but then you’re just, y’know,
  adding to the problem, because the guy you let on wants to bring
  <i>his</i> family, <i>his</i> friends, and now suddenly everyone’s fighting
  each other instead of defending the boat. The lifeboat sinks, everyone dies,
  and <i>nobody</i> is better off just because you did the ‘nice’ thing. In
  order to survive, we have to <i>fight,</i> and to fight we have to be united
  by something stronger. A shared culture, shared blood. I know no one
  <i>else</i> is going to fight for me, all the other races only ever stick up
  for themselves. So why shouldn’t we?”<br />
  <br />
  Seth shrugged helplessly. “Look, I’m all for protecting my own culture. I
  don’t have any problem with that, and I’m proud to be white too. It’s a good
  thing, right? I don’t know what else to tell you, though. All the Asians can
  fuck right off back to where they came from, but I don’t see the point of
  being so hung up over the blacks and gays and Jews. It just seems... kinda
  pointless, you know?”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shook his head. “I’m sorry if it’s hard to accept, but including blacks
  and gays and whatever else is a luxury we just can’t <i>afford</i>. Black
  people and their problems are a liability in this fight, you don’t have to
  hate them, but that’s just a <i>fact</i>. They’re less than 13% of the
  population, but they commit the majority of the crimes. White people have an
  IQ of 100 and black people have an IQ of 80. That’s just the truth, and it
  won’t change for anybody’s politically correct <i>bullshit</i>. It’s just
  nature, and it’s nobody’s <i>fault,</i> but whose fault it is doesn’t matter.
  What matters is <i>survival,</i> and I’m sorry, but you’re not gonna survive
  if you rely on black people or gay people. Just look at Africa. Just look at
  the Roman Empire.”<br />
  <br />
  “No, no, no. I get that part, but I just... does it <i>have</i> to be all
  swastikas and Sieg heils and shit? I mean, no offense, but like, it seems like
  you’re going too far in the other direction. This isn’t Germany in the ‘30s.
  It feels like you’re all trying to dress up for Halloween or something,” said
  Seth, looking pointedly at the guy at the bar with a swastika tattoo on his
  neck.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus waved his hand dismissively. “What, the symbols and all that? It’s just
  ways for people to rebel, or support their favorite capes in the Empire. The
  symbolism is our way of saying <i>fuck the system. </i>It’s about reclaiming
  our heritage from all the lies and bullshit, and some people...” Marcus
  gestured at Spencer’s iron cross-decorated jacket before continuing, “...Just
  like that it drives the fuckers nuts.”<br />
  <br />
  “Okay, that’s fine, I guess, I’m not against free speech or whatever.” Seth
  said sulkily, taking a swig of his beer.<br />
  <br />
  Nodding equably, Marcus tried to steer things back on track. “Letting people
  just do their own thing is okay when things are good, but we’ve
  <i>tried</i> mashing people from different cultures together, and it just
  <i>doesn’t work</i>. We need to try something else.”<br />
  <br />
  “Man, come on. It’s not like the Nazis had the best track record either, they
  did some pretty fucked up shit too.” said Seth, chuckling dryly. “Like, even
  if all you said was true, killing all the Jews or whatever just doesn’t seem
  like it would <i>help</i> anything, just make things even worse.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus felt a flash of indignation at the jibe. It was genuinely disturbing to
  hear all the old fallacies and talking points trotted out robotically, almost
  verbatim. The sheep <i>always</i> brought it around to the Holocaust, every
  single time.<br />
  <br />
  “History is written by the victors, you know that. You’ve got to think for
  <i>yourself,”</i> Marcus said, the words coming out more snidely than he
  intended. He took a quick, calming breath, and continued in a more mellow
  tone, “Allied propaganda only gets a pass because they won in the end.
  Nowadays, people think of fascism like this one-sided, cartoonish thing, just
  bad guys for Indiana Jones and Uncle Sam to punch. When normal people think of
  Nazis, they think of black-and-white newsreels with Hitler speaking
  passionately in German—but haven’t you ever noticed they never include any
  subtitles? God forbid people hear a translation, or else they might end up
  <i>agreeing</i> with him.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth frowned. “I mean, I’ve never been that into history. I guess I never
  thought about getting the other side of the story,” he conceded.<br />
  <br />
  “Well, don’t just take <i>my</i> word for it,” Marcus said quickly, sensing an
  opportunity. “You should do your own research. You might be surprised by what
  you find. Bottom line, though, the world is in desperate need of
  <i>real</i> heroes and warriors who’ll fight for what’s right.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth sighed, sagging down in his chair, holding his drink between his knees.
  “I dunno, man. You’re right that the world’s fucked, but it feels like you’re
  just getting your hopes up.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned back and smiled. “Look around. You just see a couple of guys
  talking in a bar, right? But don’t underestimate that. The Nazi Party in
  Germany started out as a bunch of passionate guys in a beer hall in Munich,
  and only ten years later they united their country, then they created one of
  the greatest war machines to ever exist. The only reason Germany lost was
  because they were badly outnumbered. Now it it’s starting again, here, in the
  United States, the most powerful country in the world, and this time, we have
  parahumans that level the—”<br />
  <br />
  “There you are, ranting about history <i>again,”</i> Spencer interrupted as he
  walked up from behind Marcus, putting his hands on Marcus’s shoulders and
  shooting a smile at Seth. “I swear, when we’re not drinkin’ or kickin’ Chink
  ass, this nerd’s got his head stuck in some old history book. He’ll talk your
  ear off if you’re not careful.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tilted his head far back to see Spencer. “Did you lose already?”<br />
  <br />
  “Nah, just wanted a smoke break. Liza’ll tan my hide if I light up in here.
  Wanna come with?” Spencer asked, already rummaging for the pack in his jacket
  pockets.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus cocked his head, considering. Seth didn’t smoke, so he wouldn’t be
  joining them, but it would probably be best to let Seth stew on Marcus’s words
  for a bit anyway. “Eh, sure. I could go for one.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus got up and followed Spencer out the door. Rudy and Liza didn’t
  appreciate people smoking out front—both of them were health nuts that hated
  secondhand smoke—so they’d set up a semi-enclosed little stoop in the side
  alley for smokers, with an overhang to ward away the rain and a pair of
  standing ashtrays.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer lit up a cig, and offered Marcus one with the lighter.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus lit his own, and took a lazy drag. Spencer didn’t buy the best
  cigarettes, but at least he avoided the cheapest shit available.<br />
  <br />
  Taking another drag, Marcus tried his best to savor the rich smoke despite the
  chilly night air. He was just about to take another pull when he heard a loud
  <i>thump</i> from nearby, making him cough in surprise.<br />
  <br />
  There was a shuffling sound in the alley, down on the side with the dead end.
  Someone was there the whole time? Marcus peered into the darkness, but it was
  almost impossible to see beyond the cone of wan, yellow light cast by the
  single bulb installed in the overhang. Marcus saw the guy in the shadows
  first, and lightly slapped Spencer’s shoulder, pointing his friend towards the
  newcomer. It was a guy in a hoodie.<br />
  <br />
  "The fuck d’you want?" Spencer asked, a bit muffled from the cigarette he held
  in his lips.<br />
  <br />
  "Are you two Empire Eighty-Eight?” the hooded man asked tersely. He was
  fidgeting and trembling uncontrollably, which Marcus immediately pegged as
  drug withdrawal. As the man stepped closer to the light, Marcus could see he
  had that unmistakable hungry look to him, but he was also wearing Empire
  colors.<br />
  <br />
  That gave Marcus pause, but his confusion resolved as quickly as it had
  arisen. This dude was clearly one of the Merchant’s degenerates, probably
  trying to pick a fight or dress up as one of them and steal some drugs or
  something. The dumbass had picked the <i>worst</i> possible place to do it,
  though.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus and Spencer exchanged a skeptical look before refocusing on the
  junkie.<br />
  <br />
  "Yeah, we’re Empire—but just coming right up and asking, that’s a first," said
  Spencer, smiling humorlessly. "But this ain’t a fuckin’ charity. We don’t give
  freebies to losers on the street just ‘cause they’re white. Fuck off.”<br />
  <br />
  The hoodie guy said nothing, his gaze hawkish and intense. Marcus felt his
  stomach tense at the creepy look in the hooded man’s eyes. He moved closer,
  striding right towards them.<br />
  <br />
  Was this guy for <i>real?</i> He must have been jonesing <i>hard</i> to think
  taking on two-on-one odds was a good idea, even without the gun.<br />
  <br />
  “You asked for it, motherfucker,” Spencer snarled, reaching into his jacket
  and pulling out his huge Ruger Blackhawk revolver. The dark gray metal made it
  almost impossible to see in the dark, but the menacing shape of Spencer’s
  beloved .357 magnum would be unmistakable, even to a junkie.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus didn’t even have time to register what the hooded man was doing when
  his left hand slapped the gun out of Spencer’s grip before he could even cock
  the hammer. In nearly the same instant, the hooded man’s right hand seized
  Spencer by the neck, then he kicked Marcus in the gut with a visceral
  <i>crunch</i> that radiated through Marcus’s whole body. Pain exploded in his
  midsection as he was lifted off his feet by the force of the blow, his back
  slamming into the concrete ashtray and sending him spinning into the
  ground.<br />
  <br />
  After a moment of disorientation, with blinding stars dancing in Marcus’s
  vision, the pain truly hit in full, and he couldn’t even <i>breathe</i>. It
  felt like he’d been broken in <i>half</i>. His stomach and back radiated with
  pure, overwhelming agony, and he curled up on his side, his beers and
  hamburger coming back up, the bitter acid and alcohol burning his throat and
  sinuses.<br />
  <br />
  After the brief convulsion of vomiting ended, Marcus struggled to take the
  smallest of breaths. He blinked the stars out of his streaming eyes only to
  watch as the guy in the hoodie—<i>the unmasked cape, </i>he realized—lifted
  Spencer off his feet by the neck.<br />
  <br />
  The parahuman didn’t even flinch as Spencer flailed and struggled, punching
  his face and clawing at his icy blue eyes. Then, the parahuman’s arms
  <i>transformed</i> somehow, sprouting into a mass of dark, jagged cables that
  stabbed into Spencer’s body, dragging him into the monster whose entire upper
  body split apart into a flurry of countless lashing blades.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer was <i>shredded</i>.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer’s clothes were ripped away and his body burst open like an overfilled
  grocery bag, blood and viscera splattering out of his dismembered body in
  unbelievable quantities. A moment later, the entrails were drawn into the
  monster’s body like food getting sucked down into a blender. Marcus saw a
  pale, mauled section of Spencer’s torso briefly surface from the seething
  mass, the meat and skin stretching obscenely as it was torn away from the
  bloody ribs, and a moment later the dripping, red segment of ribcage was
  crushed back down into the mass of fanged tentacles.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus would have vomited again from sheer <i>terror</i> if he’d had the
  capacity to, but for the moment all he could do was try and fail to breathe.
  Where his vision wasn’t blurry from tears, there was blackness fading in
  around the edges, whether from lack of air or oncoming shock from his
  injury.<br />
  <br />
  There were no thoughts of calling for help or fighting back. Marcus only felt
  bone-deep agony and overwhelming, electrifying fear. The need to be somewhere,
  <i>anywhere</i> else paradoxically froze him in place, as if his body had
  overridden his brain and was trying to hide in plain sight or offer abject
  surrender. Spencer had just <i>died, </i>it was unbelievable, it didn’t make
  any <i>sense,</i> this place was supposed to be <i>safe</i>—but Marcus was
  certain that he was next.<br />
  <br />
  The monster was resolving into a humanoid shape again. The thing compressed
  itself, crunching down and ejecting spurts of blood and chunks of gore like a
  squeezed sponge as it shrank down to the size and shape of a human again.
  Marcus felt the hot wetness splatter over him, but didn’t dare blink or look
  away.<br />
  <br />
  In moments, the tentacled thing had molded back together like clay and changed
  color to become the hooded figure once more, clothes and all. It was
  spotlessly clean despite standing in a huge, spreading pool of blood and bits
  of Spencer that cascaded down the short steps and into the alley beyond.<br />
  <br />
  “Damn,” said the monster wearing human skin. “All that and I’m still
  hungry.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus could hardly believe his own ears. The thing sounded mildly
  disappointed, almost <i>bored,</i> like he’d gotten the wrong order at a
  drive-thru.<br />
  <br />
  He killed Spencer and <i>that</i> was all he had to say?<br />
  <br />
  That spark of rage was what finally broke Marcus free from the paralysis of
  terror.<br />
  <br />
  He couldn’t move much, but he saw where Spencer’s Ruger had clattered against
  the wall and fallen nearby. With a desperate adrenaline-fueled lunge that
  ignited the pain in his back, Marcus grabbed the gun and aimed—<br />
  <br />
  There was a blur of motion, a tight feeling in his arm and shoulder. His arm
  moved <i>wrongly,</i> the angles not matching.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus saw his right forearm falling in four pieces from the bloody stump of
  his elbow. Blood fountained from the stump, the warm wetness spreading over
  his shirt. It just felt numb.<br />
  <br />
  looking up, Marcus saw that the monster had transformed its fingers into long,
  thin, scythe-like claws that were almost hypnotic in the effortless,
  quicksilver way they moved, like the swaying of a cobra about to strike. He
  looked away from the claws, and met the thing’s pale, dead eyes. There was no
  anger, no regret, no humanity, just <i>hunger</i>. The thing didn’t even care
  at all that Marcus was a human being, he realized in an instant of
  understanding. It just saw Marcus as an acceptable target.<br />
  <br />
  Then the pain hit in earnest, a searing fire in Marcus’s shoulder and arm. He
  let out what little breath he’d had left in a shuddering moan as he clutched
  the stump close to his chest.<br />
  <br />
  No. No. No. <i>No</i>. This couldn’t be happening. Not here. He had to get
  away...<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tried to move, but he couldn’t. He was too weak. He hurt so, so much,
  he was so tired. All he wanted was to go to sleep, and not have to deal with
  this pain anymore. He wanted to go to sleep and wake up in bed back home, back
  with his family.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus squeezed his eyes shut, tears spilling out. He remembered all the
  stupid arguments he had with his family, how much they begged him to stay home
  and not join the Empire.<br />
  <br />
  <i>I’m sorry, Mom. I’m sorry, Cass.</i><br />
  <br />
  The last thing Marcus felt besides the pain and regret was the sensation of
  being lifted up off the ground.<br />
  <br />
  <b
    >A/N <br />
    Still with me after this chapter? Good. I was really nervous about this one,
    for obvious reasons. Humanizing Nazis and depicting their propaganda is
    always a perilous thing, although it is vitally important to the story to do
    so, for reasons that will become clear later. Needless to say, the opinions
    of the characters do not reflect the author’s, yadda yadda. Marcus is
    supposed to come off as a jumped-up know-nothing wehraboo and a hypocrite,
    but still just a scared, misguided teen underneath. I hope that came
    through.<br />
    <br />
    In other news, I have launched a new contest! It can be found under the
    Apocrypha thread. I can announce here that two prizes have been claimed thus
    far—congratulations again to TheLastOne, who won a bespoke chapter and

  <b>Infection 2.M</b><br />
  <br />
  Marcus lounged in the Eagle’s Nest, slowly sinking into one of the bar’s
  comfortable leather couches. He was nursing his second tall glass of beer that
  night, mindful not to let the pleasant buzz muddle his thoughts. He wanted his
  mind to stay relatively sharp, but also keep the atmosphere relaxed. Marcus
  was admittedly a lightweight, in more ways than one, and it didn’t take much
  alcohol to get a good buzz going—unlike his best friend Spencer, who sat in a
  matching armchair to his left.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer charitably described himself as ‘husky,’ in stark contrast to Marcus,
  and as a result Spencer could pound away drinks all night long and barely show
  it. He was currently demolishing a fourth beer. That was fine, since he wasn’t
  here to do the talking anyway. Spencer was around more to provide Marcus moral
  support and, admittedly, to complement him with a more normal and less serious
  side of things. It had been Spencer’s idea to invite the third member of their
  little group.<br />
  <br />
  On Marcus’s right sat Seth, the younger brother of an old high school friend
  of Spencer’s. Seth might have been okay with drinking alongside Spencer and
  Marcus—at least partly because he couldn’t get easy access to booze anywhere
  else—but he wasn’t a member of the Empire Eighty-Eight like Spencer and Marcus
  were. Marcus hoped to change that tonight. He had been noticed for his budding
  talent at changing minds, having brought two other members into the Empire in
  just six months, and adding a third would help him move up in the
  organization.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tended to prefer the deep and serious approach to recruitment, but
  Spencer was good at just making friends. He often reminded Marcus of a dog, in
  both good and bad ways. Spencer was friendly, silly, and a bit too fond of
  food, but he was brave and loyal when it counted the most. Marcus couldn’t
  have asked for a better friend, or a better partner in crime to try winning
  over hearts and minds. Spencer could handle the heart, while Marcus would
  target the mind.<br />
  <br />
  Seth had started out nervous when he’d entered the bar, but with the help of
  Spencer’s happy-go-lucky teasing and antics, he’d mellowed out considerably.
  That was good—it would make the next part easier.<br />
  <br />
  “What’s with the dopey smile?” Spencer asked Marcus.<br />
  <br />
  “Just thinkin’ about days gone by. You know. High school. How glad I am to put
  that shit behind me,” said Marcus, smirking at Seth before taking another sip
  of beer.<br />
  <br />
  “Yeah, man. Ancient history,” Seth responded with heavy irony, conveniently
  ignoring that he was 17 and still a senior at Winslow High.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer snorted. “Oh, fuck off with your <i>ancient history</i>. If it weren’t
  for us vouching for you, Liza would have tossed you out on your ass for
  showing up with that two-bit fake I.D.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth gestured at Marcus. “He’s only one grade ahead of me, why aren’t you
  getting on <i>his</i> case?”<br />
  <br />
  “It’s not about drinking age, it’s about who you <i>know</i>. Marcus and I are
  members of the club. You’re just our guest,” Spencer said sagely.<br />
  <br />
  “Come on, Spence,” Marcus gently chided. “He’s just here to relax and have a
  good time. This isn’t a members-only bar.”<br />
  <br />
  Spencer scoffed. “Like hell it isn’t! Look around, do you see
  <i>anyone</i> who’s not white?”<br />
  <br />
  “It’s more than just that. If all they did was keep out Merchants and homeless
  trash, that would be kind of a low bar,” Marcus pointed out.<br />
  <br />
  “Pun intended, right? You get weird when you drink, I ever tell you that? All
  serious and philly-<i>philosophical</i>. It’s fuckin’... nerdy as shit.”
  Spencer said, stumbling a bit over his words.<br />
  <br />
  “Whereas <i>you</i> get all tongue-tied,” Marcus deadpanned.<br />
  <br />
  “I’ll have you know I’m fluent in sign language too, jackass.” said Spencer,
  flipping Marcus the bird and then launching into an elaborate pantomime with a
  lot of pointing and unintelligible arm-chopping motions.<br />
  <br />
  “The hell are you even doing?” Seth laughed.<br />
  <br />
  “Lettin’ Marcus know he’s a sad little stick-in-the-mud.” said Spencer,
  stopping his wild gestures.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shrugged. Spencer’s teasing had long since stopped making him feel
  offended, not when he knew Spencer wasn’t really serious and tried to insult
  just about everyone he thought he could get away with.<br />
  <br />
  “Come on, you fuckin’ <i>lump</i>. Don’t you at least wanna play pool or
  something?” Spencer wheedled. He could be surprisingly shrewish for a guy with
  a beer belly and deep baritone voice.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus rolled his eyes. “Even <i>sober</i> you couldn’t hit the broad side of
  a barn, much less a billiard ball. Maybe try your luck with Landon over there,
  he looks like he can barely stand. If you can beat him, get back to me.”<br />
  <br />
  Spencer stood up and walked off, muttering. “I dunno why I hang around with
  such a stuck-up little toothpick.”<br />
  <br />
  Chuckling at his friend, Marcus settled back, relaxing. He let the sounds of
  the room wash over him, the charging beat of the rock music playing at medium
  volume in the background, the murmur of the crowd, the clink of glasses and
  silverware. He loved relaxing at the Eagle’s Nest. It was a safe haven full of
  simple pleasures, a stress-free environment compared to the howling goddamn
  insanity that was Brockton Bay.<br />
  <br />
  Seth, however, was fidgeting and seemed quite restless. His fear at being
  busted for underage drinking had evaporated, but he still looked like he
  didn’t quite know what to do with himself in this place where he stuck out
  like a sore thumb. He was the only one in the whole bar with shoulder-length
  brown hair, everyone else was either a natural or dyed blonde like Marcus, or
  a skinhead like Spencer.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus waited patiently. The topic of the Empire’s ideology was going to come
  up eventually. People didn’t listen when you tried to shove your worldview
  down their throats, they just got defensive and shut down, he knew that much
  from bitter experience with his mom and sister. If you just left the door open
  and answered their questions, though, they’d be a lot more receptive to what
  you had to say.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus’s gaze fell on the elaborately wrought iron eagle mounted in the corner
  near the ceiling, holding the corners of two flags in its claws. One was the
  Imperial German war ensign, the other an Iron Cross on a black background. It
  made Marcus feel a warm flush of pride.<br />
  <br />
  “Hey, Marcus. What are you thinking about?” Seth finally asked.<br />
  <br />
  “Just appreciating the vexillolography,” Marcus said, nodding at the flag.<br />
  <br />
  “Gesundheit,” said Seth, raising an eyebrow.<br />
  <br />
  “It means the art of the flags. There’s a lot of meaning behind every element
  in the colors and symbols.” Marcus said.<br />
  <br />
  “I’ve been meaning to ask you about that—not the flag, I mean, but all the
  Nazi stuff. Like, I know the Nazis had some cool shit and all, but I don’t get
  why you and your, uh, <i>friends</i> are all gung-ho about them. You’re not
  even German.” Seth pointed out.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus chuckled, leaning forward. “You know, I’m <i>so</i> glad you asked
  about the <i>good news...!”</i> he said with mock brightness, doing his best
  door-knocking evangelist impression.<br />
  <br />
  “Oh, God, spare me the sales pitch. Forget I said anything!” said Seth,
  covering his eyes.<br />
  <br />
  They both laughed together, in that un-self-conscious way that only partially
  inebriated people could manage.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned back, sighing after the laughing fit passed. “Seriously, though,
  dude. I won’t push, but do you really want to know?”<br />
  <br />
  Seth shrugged. “I mean, kinda? I’ve always been more interested in the biker
  and metalhead scenes, but if you hang out around those long enough, you pick
  up a thing or two. I don’t really get it, though. I mean, don’t get me wrong,
  I hate those ABB motherfuckers, but I don’t get the jump from that to, like,
  full-on Nazis.”<br />
  <br />
  “I think you understand more than you think,” Marcus said, holding up a hand.
  “Maybe it’ll help to give you an example. For me, I started coming around when
  I began noticing that something was really wrong with the world.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth scoffed. “There’s a <i>lot</i> wrong with the world. There’s wars and
  Endbringers and the Water Crisis and all that shit.”<br />
  <br />
  “I mean besides the obvious. There’s something rotten with
  <i>normal</i> people, the way they think and act. You know, just culture in
  general,” Marcus pressed, waving a finger in a circle as if to encompass the
  whole world. “Didn’t everything seem so much more hopeful when we were kids? I
  mean, we were both born after the Golden Age of Superheroes ended, but things
  weren’t so bad on the surface. Behemoth came around before I could really
  remember, but people didn’t really know what that had <i>meant</i> yet. Do you
  remember when Jörmungandr first appeared?”<br />
  <br />
  “Who?” asked Seth, his brow knitting in confusion.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned in closer, quietly listing off the names of the beast.
  “Jörmungandr. The Second. The Serpent. <i>Leviathan</i>.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus saw a spark of interest in Seth’s eyes, and knew he’d hit pay dirt, a
  true connection. The truth that can only be uncovered by shared experience.<br />
  <br />
  “I do,” Seth said, his voice coming out hushed, subconsciously mirroring
  Marcus’ own serious tone. “What’s that got to do with Nazis, though?”<br />
  <br />
  <i>“Everything,”</i> Marcus said, spreading his arms wide. “It’s all
  connected. I’ll tell you the story, if you like.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth still looked a little skeptical, but he’d picked up on Marcus’s serious
  mood. He nodded solemnly.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus mentally girded himself, disciplining his thoughts into order. It was
  hard being a recruiter. He had to bare his soul and confront some heavy shit,
  the dark truths that everyone knew but preferred to ignore. And he had to do
  all that with total conviction and confidence, without flinching away from the
  uncomfortable parts. It opened Marcus up to mockery or attacks or joking
  deflections, but it was necessary. People could sense insincerity a mile away.
  He had to make himself vulnerable to be believed, then build that connection
  up into something strong.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus took a deep breath, and began his story.<br />
  <br />
  “One of my earliest memories was watching TV with my big sister, some cartoon
  or something. Suddenly, the movie cut out, and it started showing the news, so
  my sister tried changing the channel, but it was all the same thing on
  <i>every</i> channel, talking about Jörmungandr appearing for the first time.
  I was just a little kid, I didn’t know what was going on, and Cass wouldn’t
  tell me, so I called out to Mom. She came into the living room, and then she
  just <i>froze</i>. I don’t really remember what the news was saying, but I’ll
  never forget the look on her face. How she went all still and white. Seeing my
  mom, standing there like a statue, just... I could tell she was rooted by pure
  <i>fear, </i>and it scared me more than anything I’d ever seen in my life.
  Then she grabbed both of us, hugging us so hard it <i>hurt,</i> and even
  though she couldn’t stop <i>crying,</i> she still didn’t look away from the
  TV, not even once. We didn’t understand what happened, but it was mom’s
  reaction that made it <i>real</i>. After that, I saw the despair everywhere,
  but I didn’t understand it, what that really <i>meant</i> for the world, not
  until years later.”<br />
  <br />
  As Marcus spoke, he felt chills racing down his body, goosebumps rippling out
  over his arms at reliving the memory.<br />
  <br />
  “Are you talking about Leviathan being the reason for the boat graveyard, and
  the city’s economy getting fucked up?” Seth asked as Marcus took a drink to
  soothe his suddenly dry throat.<br />
  <br />
  “That’s only a tiny part of it. <i>Everything</i> went downhill from there,
  <i>everywhere</i>. You and I, our generation, we could feel it even when we
  were kids, and growing up it only got worse. Think about it—when Jörmungandr
  sank Kyushu, that’s when all the immigrants started flooding in. Not just in
  Brockton Bay with the ABB turning the place into a shithole, there’s
  <i>millions</i> of refugees all over, and it’s only going to get a thousand
  times worse in a few years. So what’s <i>wrong</i> with people? They’re all
  <i>terrified, </i>but they’re pretending that they aren’t. People are too busy
  with sports or celebrities or drugs or whatever pointless, petty bullshit they
  use to distract themselves from thinking.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth nodded. “Oh yeah. It’s all total bullshit, we can agree on that part.
  People would rather have their comfortable lies instead of the hard truth. I
  don’t sign on to all the race stuff, though.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus felt his cheeks flush a little with his frustration, and hoped it
  didn’t show. The pitch had started well, but now it felt like he was losing
  Seth, so he decided to go for one of his trump cards. “About the race stuff, I
  get it. I do. We’ve been taught from birth it’s bad. Kumbaya and give peace a
  chance and all that shit the mass media pushes to keep everyone in line. But
  you can just as easily say <i>fighting</i> is bad. There’s no room for that
  out in the <i>real</i> world, where things like fighting and racism are
  sometimes <i>necessary</i>. I’ve heard it explained this way, and it really
  stuck with me: think of the world like a sinking ship. Your country—as in,
  your culture, that’s the lifeboat.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth raised a skeptical eyebrow. “So you’re saying we’re like the
  <i>Titanic</i>, and the Jews are like the iceberg or something?”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shook his head, resisting the urge to call out Seth’s stupidity. “No,
  not at all. What I mean is, the ship’s like the world, and it’s already
  sinking, there’s nothing we can do to stop it now. Think of white culture as
  the last lifeboat. Everyone knows it’s their best chance, so everyone’s
  flocking to it. But if too many people try to climb on the lifeboat, they’ll
  sink the whole thing for everyone. Sure, you can give up your spot on the boat
  if you want to be <i>nice</i> or whatever, but then you’re just, y’know,
  adding to the problem, because the guy you let on wants to bring
  <i>his</i> family, <i>his</i> friends, and now suddenly everyone’s fighting
  each other instead of defending the boat. The lifeboat sinks, everyone dies,
  and <i>nobody</i> is better off just because you did the ‘nice’ thing. In
  order to survive, we have to <i>fight,</i> and to fight we have to be united
  by something stronger. A shared culture, shared blood. I know no one
  <i>else</i> is going to fight for me, all the other races only ever stick up
  for themselves. So why shouldn’t we?”<br />
  <br />
  Seth shrugged helplessly. “Look, I’m all for protecting my own culture. I
  don’t have any problem with that, and I’m proud to be white too. It’s a good
  thing, right? I don’t know what else to tell you, though. All the Asians can
  fuck right off back to where they came from, but I don’t see the point of
  being so hung up over the blacks and gays and Jews. It just seems... kinda
  pointless, you know?”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shook his head. “I’m sorry if it’s hard to accept, but including blacks
  and gays and whatever else is a luxury we just can’t <i>afford</i>. Black
  people and their problems are a liability in this fight, you don’t have to
  hate them, but that’s just a <i>fact</i>. They’re less than 13% of the
  population, but they commit the majority of the crimes. White people have an
  IQ of 100 and black people have an IQ of 80. That’s just the truth, and it
  won’t change for anybody’s politically correct <i>bullshit</i>. It’s just
  nature, and it’s nobody’s <i>fault,</i> but whose fault it is doesn’t matter.
  What matters is <i>survival,</i> and I’m sorry, but you’re not gonna survive
  if you rely on black people or gay people. Just look at Africa. Just look at
  the Roman Empire.”<br />
  <br />
  “No, no, no. I get that part, but I just... does it <i>have</i> to be all
  swastikas and Sieg heils and shit? I mean, no offense, but like, it seems like
  you’re going too far in the other direction. This isn’t Germany in the ‘30s.
  It feels like you’re all trying to dress up for Halloween or something,” said
  Seth, looking pointedly at the guy at the bar with a swastika tattoo on his
  neck.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus waved his hand dismissively. “What, the symbols and all that? It’s just
  ways for people to rebel, or support their favorite capes in the Empire. The
  symbolism is our way of saying <i>fuck the system. </i>It’s about reclaiming
  our heritage from all the lies and bullshit, and some people...” Marcus
  gestured at Spencer’s iron cross-decorated jacket before continuing, “...Just
  like that it drives the fuckers nuts.”<br />
  <br />
  “Okay, that’s fine, I guess, I’m not against free speech or whatever.” Seth
  said sulkily, taking a swig of his beer.<br />
  <br />
  Nodding equably, Marcus tried to steer things back on track. “Letting people
  just do their own thing is okay when things are good, but we’ve
  <i>tried</i> mashing people from different cultures together, and it just
  <i>doesn’t work</i>. We need to try something else.”<br />
  <br />
  “Man, come on. It’s not like the Nazis had the best track record either, they
  did some pretty fucked up shit too.” said Seth, chuckling dryly. “Like, even
  if all you said was true, killing all the Jews or whatever just doesn’t seem
  like it would <i>help</i> anything, just make things even worse.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus felt a flash of indignation at the jibe. It was genuinely disturbing to
  hear all the old fallacies and talking points trotted out robotically, almost
  verbatim. The sheep <i>always</i> brought it around to the Holocaust, every
  single time.<br />
  <br />
  “History is written by the victors, you know that. You’ve got to think for
  <i>yourself,”</i> Marcus said, the words coming out more snidely than he
  intended. He took a quick, calming breath, and continued in a more mellow
  tone, “Allied propaganda only gets a pass because they won in the end.
  Nowadays, people think of fascism like this one-sided, cartoonish thing, just
  bad guys for Indiana Jones and Uncle Sam to punch. When normal people think of
  Nazis, they think of black-and-white newsreels with Hitler speaking
  passionately in German—but haven’t you ever noticed they never include any
  subtitles? God forbid people hear a translation, or else they might end up
  <i>agreeing</i> with him.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth frowned. “I mean, I’ve never been that into history. I guess I never
  thought about getting the other side of the story,” he conceded.<br />
  <br />
  “Well, don’t just take <i>my</i> word for it,” Marcus said quickly, sensing an
  opportunity. “You should do your own research. You might be surprised by what
  you find. Bottom line, though, the world is in desperate need of
  <i>real</i> heroes and warriors who’ll fight for what’s right.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth sighed, sagging down in his chair, holding his drink between his knees.
  “I dunno, man. You’re right that the world’s fucked, but it feels like you’re
  just getting your hopes up.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned back and smiled. “Look around. You just see a couple of guys
  talking in a bar, right? But don’t underestimate that. The Nazi Party in
  Germany started out as a bunch of passionate guys in a beer hall in Munich,
  and only ten years later they united their country, then they created one of
  the greatest war machines to ever exist. The only reason Germany lost was
  because they were badly outnumbered. Now it it’s starting again, here, in the
  United States, the most powerful country in the world, and this time, we have
  parahumans that level the—”<br />
  <br />
  “There you are, ranting about history <i>again,”</i> Spencer interrupted as he
  walked up from behind Marcus, putting his hands on Marcus’s shoulders and
  shooting a smile at Seth. “I swear, when we’re not drinkin’ or kickin’ Chink
  ass, this nerd’s got his head stuck in some old history book. He’ll talk your
  ear off if you’re not careful.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tilted his head far back to see Spencer. “Did you lose already?”<br />
  <br />
  “Nah, just wanted a smoke break. Liza’ll tan my hide if I light up in here.
  Wanna come with?” Spencer asked, already rummaging for the pack in his jacket
  pockets.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus cocked his head, considering. Seth didn’t smoke, so he wouldn’t be
  joining them, but it would probably be best to let Seth stew on Marcus’s words
  for a bit anyway. “Eh, sure. I could go for one.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus got up and followed Spencer out the door. Rudy and Liza didn’t
  appreciate people smoking out front—both of them were health nuts that hated
  secondhand smoke—so they’d set up a semi-enclosed little stoop in the side
  alley for smokers, with an overhang to ward away the rain and a pair of
  standing ashtrays.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer lit up a cig, and offered Marcus one with the lighter.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus lit his own, and took a lazy drag. Spencer didn’t buy the best
  cigarettes, but at least he avoided the cheapest shit available.<br />
  <br />
  Taking another drag, Marcus tried his best to savor the rich smoke despite the
  chilly night air. He was just about to take another pull when he heard a loud
  <i>thump</i> from nearby, making him cough in surprise.<br />
  <br />
  There was a shuffling sound in the alley, down on the side with the dead end.
  Someone was there the whole time? Marcus peered into the darkness, but it was
  almost impossible to see beyond the cone of wan, yellow light cast by the
  single bulb installed in the overhang. Marcus saw the guy in the shadows
  first, and lightly slapped Spencer’s shoulder, pointing his friend towards the
  newcomer. It was a guy in a hoodie.<br />
  <br />
  "The fuck d’you want?" Spencer asked, a bit muffled from the cigarette he held
  in his lips.<br />
  <br />
  "Are you two Empire Eighty-Eight?” the hooded man asked tersely. He was
  fidgeting and trembling uncontrollably, which Marcus immediately pegged as
  drug withdrawal. As the man stepped closer to the light, Marcus could see he
  had that unmistakable hungry look to him, but he was also wearing Empire
  colors.<br />
  <br />
  That gave Marcus pause, but his confusion resolved as quickly as it had
  arisen. This dude was clearly one of the Merchant’s degenerates, probably
  trying to pick a fight or dress up as one of them and steal some drugs or
  something. The dumbass had picked the <i>worst</i> possible place to do it,
  though.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus and Spencer exchanged a skeptical look before refocusing on the
  junkie.<br />
  <br />
  "Yeah, we’re Empire—but just coming right up and asking, that’s a first," said
  Spencer, smiling humorlessly. "But this ain’t a fuckin’ charity. We don’t give
  freebies to losers on the street just ‘cause they’re white. Fuck off.”<br />
  <br />
  The hoodie guy said nothing, his gaze hawkish and intense. Marcus felt his
  stomach tense at the creepy look in the hooded man’s eyes. He moved closer,
  striding right towards them.<br />
  <br />
  Was this guy for <i>real?</i> He must have been jonesing <i>hard</i> to think
  taking on two-on-one odds was a good idea, even without the gun.<br />
  <br />
  “You asked for it, motherfucker,” Spencer snarled, reaching into his jacket
  and pulling out his huge Ruger Blackhawk revolver. The dark gray metal made it
  almost impossible to see in the dark, but the menacing shape of Spencer’s
  beloved .357 magnum would be unmistakable, even to a junkie.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus didn’t even have time to register what the hooded man was doing when
  his left hand slapped the gun out of Spencer’s grip before he could even cock
  the hammer. In nearly the same instant, the hooded man’s right hand seized
  Spencer by the neck, then he kicked Marcus in the gut with a visceral
  <i>crunch</i> that radiated through Marcus’s whole body. Pain exploded in his
  midsection as he was lifted off his feet by the force of the blow, his back
  slamming into the concrete ashtray and sending him spinning into the
  ground.<br />
  <br />
  After a moment of disorientation, with blinding stars dancing in Marcus’s
  vision, the pain truly hit in full, and he couldn’t even <i>breathe</i>. It
  felt like he’d been broken in <i>half</i>. His stomach and back radiated with
  pure, overwhelming agony, and he curled up on his side, his beers and
  hamburger coming back up, the bitter acid and alcohol burning his throat and
  sinuses.<br />
  <br />
  After the brief convulsion of vomiting ended, Marcus struggled to take the
  smallest of breaths. He blinked the stars out of his streaming eyes only to
  watch as the guy in the hoodie—<i>the unmasked cape, </i>he realized—lifted
  Spencer off his feet by the neck.<br />
  <br />
  The parahuman didn’t even flinch as Spencer flailed and struggled, punching
  his face and clawing at his icy blue eyes. Then, the parahuman’s arms
  <i>transformed</i> somehow, sprouting into a mass of dark, jagged cables that
  stabbed into Spencer’s body, dragging him into the monster whose entire upper
  body split apart into a flurry of countless lashing blades.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer was <i>shredded</i>.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer’s clothes were ripped away and his body burst open like an overfilled
  grocery bag, blood and viscera splattering out of his dismembered body in
  unbelievable quantities. A moment later, the entrails were drawn into the
  monster’s body like food getting sucked down into a blender. Marcus saw a
  pale, mauled section of Spencer’s torso briefly surface from the seething
  mass, the meat and skin stretching obscenely as it was torn away from the
  bloody ribs, and a moment later the dripping, red segment of ribcage was
  crushed back down into the mass of fanged tentacles.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus would have vomited again from sheer <i>terror</i> if he’d had the
  capacity to, but for the moment all he could do was try and fail to breathe.
  Where his vision wasn’t blurry from tears, there was blackness fading in
  around the edges, whether from lack of air or oncoming shock from his
  injury.<br />
  <br />
  There were no thoughts of calling for help or fighting back. Marcus only felt
  bone-deep agony and overwhelming, electrifying fear. The need to be somewhere,
  <i>anywhere</i> else paradoxically froze him in place, as if his body had
  overridden his brain and was trying to hide in plain sight or offer abject
  surrender. Spencer had just <i>died, </i>it was unbelievable, it didn’t make
  any <i>sense,</i> this place was supposed to be <i>safe</i>—but Marcus was
  certain that he was next.<br />
  <br />
  The monster was resolving into a humanoid shape again. The thing compressed
  itself, crunching down and ejecting spurts of blood and chunks of gore like a
  squeezed sponge as it shrank down to the size and shape of a human again.
  Marcus felt the hot wetness splatter over him, but didn’t dare blink or look
  away.<br />
  <br />
  In moments, the tentacled thing had molded back together like clay and changed
  color to become the hooded figure once more, clothes and all. It was
  spotlessly clean despite standing in a huge, spreading pool of blood and bits
  of Spencer that cascaded down the short steps and into the alley beyond.<br />
  <br />
  “Damn,” said the monster wearing human skin. “All that and I’m still
  hungry.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus could hardly believe his own ears. The thing sounded mildly
  disappointed, almost <i>bored,</i> like he’d gotten the wrong order at a
  drive-thru.<br />
  <br />
  He killed Spencer and <i>that</i> was all he had to say?<br />
  <br />
  That spark of rage was what finally broke Marcus free from the paralysis of
  terror.<br />
  <br />
  He couldn’t move much, but he saw where Spencer’s Ruger had clattered against
  the wall and fallen nearby. With a desperate adrenaline-fueled lunge that
  ignited the pain in his back, Marcus grabbed the gun and aimed—<br />
  <br />
  There was a blur of motion, a tight feeling in his arm and shoulder. His arm
  moved <i>wrongly,</i> the angles not matching.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus saw his right forearm falling in four pieces from the bloody stump of
  his elbow. Blood fountained from the stump, the warm wetness spreading over
  his shirt. It just felt numb.<br />
  <br />
  looking up, Marcus saw that the monster had transformed its fingers into long,
  thin, scythe-like claws that were almost hypnotic in the effortless,
  quicksilver way they moved, like the swaying of a cobra about to strike. He
  looked away from the claws, and met the thing’s pale, dead eyes. There was no
  anger, no regret, no humanity, just <i>hunger</i>. The thing didn’t even care
  at all that Marcus was a human being, he realized in an instant of
  understanding. It just saw Marcus as an acceptable target.<br />
  <br />
  Then the pain hit in earnest, a searing fire in Marcus’s shoulder and arm. He
  let out what little breath he’d had left in a shuddering moan as he clutched
  the stump close to his chest.<br />
  <br />
  No. No. No. <i>No</i>. This couldn’t be happening. Not here. He had to get
  away...<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tried to move, but he couldn’t. He was too weak. He hurt so, so much,
  he was so tired. All he wanted was to go to sleep, and not have to deal with
  this pain anymore. He wanted to go to sleep and wake up in bed back home, back
  with his family.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus squeezed his eyes shut, tears spilling out. He remembered all the
  stupid arguments he had with his family, how much they begged him to stay home
  and not join the Empire.<br />
  <br />
  <i>I’m sorry, Mom. I’m sorry, Cass.</i><br />
  <br />
  The last thing Marcus felt besides the pain and regret was the sensation of
  being lifted up off the ground.<br />
  <br />
  <b
    >A/N <br />
    Still with me after this chapter? Good. I was really nervous about this one,
    for obvious reasons. Humanizing Nazis and depicting their propaganda is
    always a perilous thing, although it is vitally important to the story to do
    so, for reasons that will become clear later. Needless to say, the opinions
    of the characters do not reflect the author’s, yadda yadda. Marcus is
    supposed to come off as a jumped-up know-nothing wehraboo and a hypocrite,
    but still just a scared, misguided teen underneath. I hope that came
    through.<br />
    <br />
    In other news, I have launched a new contest! It can be found under the
    Apocrypha thread. I can announce here that two prizes have been claimed thus
    far—congratulations again to TheLastOne, who won a bespoke chapter and
    requested a Regent interlude (timing TBD). I must also congratulate the new
    winner, InfiniteTangent, whose correct answer has won everyone a bonus
    chapter coming out this upcoming Tuesday. Thanks to everyone who
    participated! Your guesses are extremely valuable to me, for gauging my
    audience’s expectations!</b

  <b>Infection 2.M</b><br />
  <br />
  Marcus lounged in the Eagle’s Nest, slowly sinking into one of the bar’s
  comfortable leather couches. He was nursing his second tall glass of beer that
  night, mindful not to let the pleasant buzz muddle his thoughts. He wanted his
  mind to stay relatively sharp, but also keep the atmosphere relaxed. Marcus
  was admittedly a lightweight, in more ways than one, and it didn’t take much
  alcohol to get a good buzz going—unlike his best friend Spencer, who sat in a
  matching armchair to his left.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer charitably described himself as ‘husky,’ in stark contrast to Marcus,
  and as a result Spencer could pound away drinks all night long and barely show
  it. He was currently demolishing a fourth beer. That was fine, since he wasn’t
  here to do the talking anyway. Spencer was around more to provide Marcus moral
  support and, admittedly, to complement him with a more normal and less serious
  side of things. It had been Spencer’s idea to invite the third member of their
  little group.<br />
  <br />
  On Marcus’s right sat Seth, the younger brother of an old high school friend
  of Spencer’s. Seth might have been okay with drinking alongside Spencer and
  Marcus—at least partly because he couldn’t get easy access to booze anywhere
  else—but he wasn’t a member of the Empire Eighty-Eight like Spencer and Marcus
  were. Marcus hoped to change that tonight. He had been noticed for his budding
  talent at changing minds, having brought two other members into the Empire in
  just six months, and adding a third would help him move up in the
  organization.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tended to prefer the deep and serious approach to recruitment, but
  Spencer was good at just making friends. He often reminded Marcus of a dog, in
  both good and bad ways. Spencer was friendly, silly, and a bit too fond of
  food, but he was brave and loyal when it counted the most. Marcus couldn’t
  have asked for a better friend, or a better partner in crime to try winning
  over hearts and minds. Spencer could handle the heart, while Marcus would
  target the mind.<br />
  <br />
  Seth had started out nervous when he’d entered the bar, but with the help of
  Spencer’s happy-go-lucky teasing and antics, he’d mellowed out considerably.
  That was good—it would make the next part easier.<br />
  <br />
  “What’s with the dopey smile?” Spencer asked Marcus.<br />
  <br />
  “Just thinkin’ about days gone by. You know. High school. How glad I am to put
  that shit behind me,” said Marcus, smirking at Seth before taking another sip
  of beer.<br />
  <br />
  “Yeah, man. Ancient history,” Seth responded with heavy irony, conveniently
  ignoring that he was 17 and still a senior at Winslow High.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer snorted. “Oh, fuck off with your <i>ancient history</i>. If it weren’t
  for us vouching for you, Liza would have tossed you out on your ass for
  showing up with that two-bit fake I.D.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth gestured at Marcus. “He’s only one grade ahead of me, why aren’t you
  getting on <i>his</i> case?”<br />
  <br />
  “It’s not about drinking age, it’s about who you <i>know</i>. Marcus and I are
  members of the club. You’re just our guest,” Spencer said sagely.<br />
  <br />
  “Come on, Spence,” Marcus gently chided. “He’s just here to relax and have a
  good time. This isn’t a members-only bar.”<br />
  <br />
  Spencer scoffed. “Like hell it isn’t! Look around, do you see
  <i>anyone</i> who’s not white?”<br />
  <br />
  “It’s more than just that. If all they did was keep out Merchants and homeless
  trash, that would be kind of a low bar,” Marcus pointed out.<br />
  <br />
  “Pun intended, right? You get weird when you drink, I ever tell you that? All
  serious and philly-<i>philosophical</i>. It’s fuckin’... nerdy as shit.”
  Spencer said, stumbling a bit over his words.<br />
  <br />
  “Whereas <i>you</i> get all tongue-tied,” Marcus deadpanned.<br />
  <br />
  “I’ll have you know I’m fluent in sign language too, jackass.” said Spencer,
  flipping Marcus the bird and then launching into an elaborate pantomime with a
  lot of pointing and unintelligible arm-chopping motions.<br />
  <br />
  “The hell are you even doing?” Seth laughed.<br />
  <br />
  “Lettin’ Marcus know he’s a sad little stick-in-the-mud.” said Spencer,
  stopping his wild gestures.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shrugged. Spencer’s teasing had long since stopped making him feel
  offended, not when he knew Spencer wasn’t really serious and tried to insult
  just about everyone he thought he could get away with.<br />
  <br />
  “Come on, you fuckin’ <i>lump</i>. Don’t you at least wanna play pool or
  something?” Spencer wheedled. He could be surprisingly shrewish for a guy with
  a beer belly and deep baritone voice.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus rolled his eyes. “Even <i>sober</i> you couldn’t hit the broad side of
  a barn, much less a billiard ball. Maybe try your luck with Landon over there,
  he looks like he can barely stand. If you can beat him, get back to me.”<br />
  <br />
  Spencer stood up and walked off, muttering. “I dunno why I hang around with
  such a stuck-up little toothpick.”<br />
  <br />
  Chuckling at his friend, Marcus settled back, relaxing. He let the sounds of
  the room wash over him, the charging beat of the rock music playing at medium
  volume in the background, the murmur of the crowd, the clink of glasses and
  silverware. He loved relaxing at the Eagle’s Nest. It was a safe haven full of
  simple pleasures, a stress-free environment compared to the howling goddamn
  insanity that was Brockton Bay.<br />
  <br />
  Seth, however, was fidgeting and seemed quite restless. His fear at being
  busted for underage drinking had evaporated, but he still looked like he
  didn’t quite know what to do with himself in this place where he stuck out
  like a sore thumb. He was the only one in the whole bar with shoulder-length
  brown hair, everyone else was either a natural or dyed blonde like Marcus, or
  a skinhead like Spencer.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus waited patiently. The topic of the Empire’s ideology was going to come
  up eventually. People didn’t listen when you tried to shove your worldview
  down their throats, they just got defensive and shut down, he knew that much
  from bitter experience with his mom and sister. If you just left the door open
  and answered their questions, though, they’d be a lot more receptive to what
  you had to say.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus’s gaze fell on the elaborately wrought iron eagle mounted in the corner
  near the ceiling, holding the corners of two flags in its claws. One was the
  Imperial German war ensign, the other an Iron Cross on a black background. It
  made Marcus feel a warm flush of pride.<br />
  <br />
  “Hey, Marcus. What are you thinking about?” Seth finally asked.<br />
  <br />
  “Just appreciating the vexillolography,” Marcus said, nodding at the flag.<br />
  <br />
  “Gesundheit,” said Seth, raising an eyebrow.<br />
  <br />
  “It means the art of the flags. There’s a lot of meaning behind every element
  in the colors and symbols.” Marcus said.<br />
  <br />
  “I’ve been meaning to ask you about that—not the flag, I mean, but all the
  Nazi stuff. Like, I know the Nazis had some cool shit and all, but I don’t get
  why you and your, uh, <i>friends</i> are all gung-ho about them. You’re not
  even German.” Seth pointed out.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus chuckled, leaning forward. “You know, I’m <i>so</i> glad you asked
  about the <i>good news...!”</i> he said with mock brightness, doing his best
  door-knocking evangelist impression.<br />
  <br />
  “Oh, God, spare me the sales pitch. Forget I said anything!” said Seth,
  covering his eyes.<br />
  <br />
  They both laughed together, in that un-self-conscious way that only partially
  inebriated people could manage.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned back, sighing after the laughing fit passed. “Seriously, though,
  dude. I won’t push, but do you really want to know?”<br />
  <br />
  Seth shrugged. “I mean, kinda? I’ve always been more interested in the biker
  and metalhead scenes, but if you hang out around those long enough, you pick
  up a thing or two. I don’t really get it, though. I mean, don’t get me wrong,
  I hate those ABB motherfuckers, but I don’t get the jump from that to, like,
  full-on Nazis.”<br />
  <br />
  “I think you understand more than you think,” Marcus said, holding up a hand.
  “Maybe it’ll help to give you an example. For me, I started coming around when
  I began noticing that something was really wrong with the world.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth scoffed. “There’s a <i>lot</i> wrong with the world. There’s wars and
  Endbringers and the Water Crisis and all that shit.”<br />
  <br />
  “I mean besides the obvious. There’s something rotten with
  <i>normal</i> people, the way they think and act. You know, just culture in
  general,” Marcus pressed, waving a finger in a circle as if to encompass the
  whole world. “Didn’t everything seem so much more hopeful when we were kids? I
  mean, we were both born after the Golden Age of Superheroes ended, but things
  weren’t so bad on the surface. Behemoth came around before I could really
  remember, but people didn’t really know what that had <i>meant</i> yet. Do you
  remember when Jörmungandr first appeared?”<br />
  <br />
  “Who?” asked Seth, his brow knitting in confusion.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned in closer, quietly listing off the names of the beast.
  “Jörmungandr. The Second. The Serpent. <i>Leviathan</i>.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus saw a spark of interest in Seth’s eyes, and knew he’d hit pay dirt, a
  true connection. The truth that can only be uncovered by shared experience.<br />
  <br />
  “I do,” Seth said, his voice coming out hushed, subconsciously mirroring
  Marcus’ own serious tone. “What’s that got to do with Nazis, though?”<br />
  <br />
  <i>“Everything,”</i> Marcus said, spreading his arms wide. “It’s all
  connected. I’ll tell you the story, if you like.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth still looked a little skeptical, but he’d picked up on Marcus’s serious
  mood. He nodded solemnly.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus mentally girded himself, disciplining his thoughts into order. It was
  hard being a recruiter. He had to bare his soul and confront some heavy shit,
  the dark truths that everyone knew but preferred to ignore. And he had to do
  all that with total conviction and confidence, without flinching away from the
  uncomfortable parts. It opened Marcus up to mockery or attacks or joking
  deflections, but it was necessary. People could sense insincerity a mile away.
  He had to make himself vulnerable to be believed, then build that connection
  up into something strong.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus took a deep breath, and began his story.<br />
  <br />
  “One of my earliest memories was watching TV with my big sister, some cartoon
  or something. Suddenly, the movie cut out, and it started showing the news, so
  my sister tried changing the channel, but it was all the same thing on
  <i>every</i> channel, talking about Jörmungandr appearing for the first time.
  I was just a little kid, I didn’t know what was going on, and Cass wouldn’t
  tell me, so I called out to Mom. She came into the living room, and then she
  just <i>froze</i>. I don’t really remember what the news was saying, but I’ll
  never forget the look on her face. How she went all still and white. Seeing my
  mom, standing there like a statue, just... I could tell she was rooted by pure
  <i>fear, </i>and it scared me more than anything I’d ever seen in my life.
  Then she grabbed both of us, hugging us so hard it <i>hurt,</i> and even
  though she couldn’t stop <i>crying,</i> she still didn’t look away from the
  TV, not even once. We didn’t understand what happened, but it was mom’s
  reaction that made it <i>real</i>. After that, I saw the despair everywhere,
  but I didn’t understand it, what that really <i>meant</i> for the world, not
  until years later.”<br />
  <br />
  As Marcus spoke, he felt chills racing down his body, goosebumps rippling out
  over his arms at reliving the memory.<br />
  <br />
  “Are you talking about Leviathan being the reason for the boat graveyard, and
  the city’s economy getting fucked up?” Seth asked as Marcus took a drink to
  soothe his suddenly dry throat.<br />
  <br />
  “That’s only a tiny part of it. <i>Everything</i> went downhill from there,
  <i>everywhere</i>. You and I, our generation, we could feel it even when we
  were kids, and growing up it only got worse. Think about it—when Jörmungandr
  sank Kyushu, that’s when all the immigrants started flooding in. Not just in
  Brockton Bay with the ABB turning the place into a shithole, there’s
  <i>millions</i> of refugees all over, and it’s only going to get a thousand
  times worse in a few years. So what’s <i>wrong</i> with people? They’re all
  <i>terrified, </i>but they’re pretending that they aren’t. People are too busy
  with sports or celebrities or drugs or whatever pointless, petty bullshit they
  use to distract themselves from thinking.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth nodded. “Oh yeah. It’s all total bullshit, we can agree on that part.
  People would rather have their comfortable lies instead of the hard truth. I
  don’t sign on to all the race stuff, though.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus felt his cheeks flush a little with his frustration, and hoped it
  didn’t show. The pitch had started well, but now it felt like he was losing
  Seth, so he decided to go for one of his trump cards. “About the race stuff, I
  get it. I do. We’ve been taught from birth it’s bad. Kumbaya and give peace a
  chance and all that shit the mass media pushes to keep everyone in line. But
  you can just as easily say <i>fighting</i> is bad. There’s no room for that
  out in the <i>real</i> world, where things like fighting and racism are
  sometimes <i>necessary</i>. I’ve heard it explained this way, and it really
  stuck with me: think of the world like a sinking ship. Your country—as in,
  your culture, that’s the lifeboat.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth raised a skeptical eyebrow. “So you’re saying we’re like the
  <i>Titanic</i>, and the Jews are like the iceberg or something?”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shook his head, resisting the urge to call out Seth’s stupidity. “No,
  not at all. What I mean is, the ship’s like the world, and it’s already
  sinking, there’s nothing we can do to stop it now. Think of white culture as
  the last lifeboat. Everyone knows it’s their best chance, so everyone’s
  flocking to it. But if too many people try to climb on the lifeboat, they’ll
  sink the whole thing for everyone. Sure, you can give up your spot on the boat
  if you want to be <i>nice</i> or whatever, but then you’re just, y’know,
  adding to the problem, because the guy you let on wants to bring
  <i>his</i> family, <i>his</i> friends, and now suddenly everyone’s fighting
  each other instead of defending the boat. The lifeboat sinks, everyone dies,
  and <i>nobody</i> is better off just because you did the ‘nice’ thing. In
  order to survive, we have to <i>fight,</i> and to fight we have to be united
  by something stronger. A shared culture, shared blood. I know no one
  <i>else</i> is going to fight for me, all the other races only ever stick up
  for themselves. So why shouldn’t we?”<br />
  <br />
  Seth shrugged helplessly. “Look, I’m all for protecting my own culture. I
  don’t have any problem with that, and I’m proud to be white too. It’s a good
  thing, right? I don’t know what else to tell you, though. All the Asians can
  fuck right off back to where they came from, but I don’t see the point of
  being so hung up over the blacks and gays and Jews. It just seems... kinda
  pointless, you know?”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shook his head. “I’m sorry if it’s hard to accept, but including blacks
  and gays and whatever else is a luxury we just can’t <i>afford</i>. Black
  people and their problems are a liability in this fight, you don’t have to
  hate them, but that’s just a <i>fact</i>. They’re less than 13% of the
  population, but they commit the majority of the crimes. White people have an
  IQ of 100 and black people have an IQ of 80. That’s just the truth, and it
  won’t change for anybody’s politically correct <i>bullshit</i>. It’s just
  nature, and it’s nobody’s <i>fault,</i> but whose fault it is doesn’t matter.
  What matters is <i>survival,</i> and I’m sorry, but you’re not gonna survive
  if you rely on black people or gay people. Just look at Africa. Just look at
  the Roman Empire.”<br />
  <br />
  “No, no, no. I get that part, but I just... does it <i>have</i> to be all
  swastikas and Sieg heils and shit? I mean, no offense, but like, it seems like
  you’re going too far in the other direction. This isn’t Germany in the ‘30s.
  It feels like you’re all trying to dress up for Halloween or something,” said
  Seth, looking pointedly at the guy at the bar with a swastika tattoo on his
  neck.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus waved his hand dismissively. “What, the symbols and all that? It’s just
  ways for people to rebel, or support their favorite capes in the Empire. The
  symbolism is our way of saying <i>fuck the system. </i>It’s about reclaiming
  our heritage from all the lies and bullshit, and some people...” Marcus
  gestured at Spencer’s iron cross-decorated jacket before continuing, “...Just
  like that it drives the fuckers nuts.”<br />
  <br />
  “Okay, that’s fine, I guess, I’m not against free speech or whatever.” Seth
  said sulkily, taking a swig of his beer.<br />
  <br />
  Nodding equably, Marcus tried to steer things back on track. “Letting people
  just do their own thing is okay when things are good, but we’ve
  <i>tried</i> mashing people from different cultures together, and it just
  <i>doesn’t work</i>. We need to try something else.”<br />
  <br />
  “Man, come on. It’s not like the Nazis had the best track record either, they
  did some pretty fucked up shit too.” said Seth, chuckling dryly. “Like, even
  if all you said was true, killing all the Jews or whatever just doesn’t seem
  like it would <i>help</i> anything, just make things even worse.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus felt a flash of indignation at the jibe. It was genuinely disturbing to
  hear all the old fallacies and talking points trotted out robotically, almost
  verbatim. The sheep <i>always</i> brought it around to the Holocaust, every
  single time.<br />
  <br />
  “History is written by the victors, you know that. You’ve got to think for
  <i>yourself,”</i> Marcus said, the words coming out more snidely than he
  intended. He took a quick, calming breath, and continued in a more mellow
  tone, “Allied propaganda only gets a pass because they won in the end.
  Nowadays, people think of fascism like this one-sided, cartoonish thing, just
  bad guys for Indiana Jones and Uncle Sam to punch. When normal people think of
  Nazis, they think of black-and-white newsreels with Hitler speaking
  passionately in German—but haven’t you ever noticed they never include any
  subtitles? God forbid people hear a translation, or else they might end up
  <i>agreeing</i> with him.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth frowned. “I mean, I’ve never been that into history. I guess I never
  thought about getting the other side of the story,” he conceded.<br />
  <br />
  “Well, don’t just take <i>my</i> word for it,” Marcus said quickly, sensing an
  opportunity. “You should do your own research. You might be surprised by what
  you find. Bottom line, though, the world is in desperate need of
  <i>real</i> heroes and warriors who’ll fight for what’s right.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth sighed, sagging down in his chair, holding his drink between his knees.
  “I dunno, man. You’re right that the world’s fucked, but it feels like you’re
  just getting your hopes up.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned back and smiled. “Look around. You just see a couple of guys
  talking in a bar, right? But don’t underestimate that. The Nazi Party in
  Germany started out as a bunch of passionate guys in a beer hall in Munich,
  and only ten years later they united their country, then they created one of
  the greatest war machines to ever exist. The only reason Germany lost was
  because they were badly outnumbered. Now it it’s starting again, here, in the
  United States, the most powerful country in the world, and this time, we have
  parahumans that level the—”<br />
  <br />
  “There you are, ranting about history <i>again,”</i> Spencer interrupted as he
  walked up from behind Marcus, putting his hands on Marcus’s shoulders and
  shooting a smile at Seth. “I swear, when we’re not drinkin’ or kickin’ Chink
  ass, this nerd’s got his head stuck in some old history book. He’ll talk your
  ear off if you’re not careful.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tilted his head far back to see Spencer. “Did you lose already?”<br />
  <br />
  “Nah, just wanted a smoke break. Liza’ll tan my hide if I light up in here.
  Wanna come with?” Spencer asked, already rummaging for the pack in his jacket
  pockets.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus cocked his head, considering. Seth didn’t smoke, so he wouldn’t be
  joining them, but it would probably be best to let Seth stew on Marcus’s words
  for a bit anyway. “Eh, sure. I could go for one.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus got up and followed Spencer out the door. Rudy and Liza didn’t
  appreciate people smoking out front—both of them were health nuts that hated
  secondhand smoke—so they’d set up a semi-enclosed little stoop in the side
  alley for smokers, with an overhang to ward away the rain and a pair of
  standing ashtrays.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer lit up a cig, and offered Marcus one with the lighter.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus lit his own, and took a lazy drag. Spencer didn’t buy the best
  cigarettes, but at least he avoided the cheapest shit available.<br />
  <br />
  Taking another drag, Marcus tried his best to savor the rich smoke despite the
  chilly night air. He was just about to take another pull when he heard a loud
  <i>thump</i> from nearby, making him cough in surprise.<br />
  <br />
  There was a shuffling sound in the alley, down on the side with the dead end.
  Someone was there the whole time? Marcus peered into the darkness, but it was
  almost impossible to see beyond the cone of wan, yellow light cast by the
  single bulb installed in the overhang. Marcus saw the guy in the shadows
  first, and lightly slapped Spencer’s shoulder, pointing his friend towards the
  newcomer. It was a guy in a hoodie.<br />
  <br />
  "The fuck d’you want?" Spencer asked, a bit muffled from the cigarette he held
  in his lips.<br />
  <br />
  "Are you two Empire Eighty-Eight?” the hooded man asked tersely. He was
  fidgeting and trembling uncontrollably, which Marcus immediately pegged as
  drug withdrawal. As the man stepped closer to the light, Marcus could see he
  had that unmistakable hungry look to him, but he was also wearing Empire
  colors.<br />
  <br />
  That gave Marcus pause, but his confusion resolved as quickly as it had
  arisen. This dude was clearly one of the Merchant’s degenerates, probably
  trying to pick a fight or dress up as one of them and steal some drugs or
  something. The dumbass had picked the <i>worst</i> possible place to do it,
  though.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus and Spencer exchanged a skeptical look before refocusing on the
  junkie.<br />
  <br />
  "Yeah, we’re Empire—but just coming right up and asking, that’s a first," said
  Spencer, smiling humorlessly. "But this ain’t a fuckin’ charity. We don’t give
  freebies to losers on the street just ‘cause they’re white. Fuck off.”<br />
  <br />
  The hoodie guy said nothing, his gaze hawkish and intense. Marcus felt his
  stomach tense at the creepy look in the hooded man’s eyes. He moved closer,
  striding right towards them.<br />
  <br />
  Was this guy for <i>real?</i> He must have been jonesing <i>hard</i> to think
  taking on two-on-one odds was a good idea, even without the gun.<br />
  <br />
  “You asked for it, motherfucker,” Spencer snarled, reaching into his jacket
  and pulling out his huge Ruger Blackhawk revolver. The dark gray metal made it
  almost impossible to see in the dark, but the menacing shape of Spencer’s
  beloved .357 magnum would be unmistakable, even to a junkie.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus didn’t even have time to register what the hooded man was doing when
  his left hand slapped the gun out of Spencer’s grip before he could even cock
  the hammer. In nearly the same instant, the hooded man’s right hand seized
  Spencer by the neck, then he kicked Marcus in the gut with a visceral
  <i>crunch</i> that radiated through Marcus’s whole body. Pain exploded in his
  midsection as he was lifted off his feet by the force of the blow, his back
  slamming into the concrete ashtray and sending him spinning into the
  ground.<br />
  <br />
  After a moment of disorientation, with blinding stars dancing in Marcus’s
  vision, the pain truly hit in full, and he couldn’t even <i>breathe</i>. It
  felt like he’d been broken in <i>half</i>. His stomach and back radiated with
  pure, overwhelming agony, and he curled up on his side, his beers and
  hamburger coming back up, the bitter acid and alcohol burning his throat and
  sinuses.<br />
  <br />
  After the brief convulsion of vomiting ended, Marcus struggled to take the
  smallest of breaths. He blinked the stars out of his streaming eyes only to
  watch as the guy in the hoodie—<i>the unmasked cape, </i>he realized—lifted
  Spencer off his feet by the neck.<br />
  <br />
  The parahuman didn’t even flinch as Spencer flailed and struggled, punching
  his face and clawing at his icy blue eyes. Then, the parahuman’s arms
  <i>transformed</i> somehow, sprouting into a mass of dark, jagged cables that
  stabbed into Spencer’s body, dragging him into the monster whose entire upper
  body split apart into a flurry of countless lashing blades.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer was <i>shredded</i>.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer’s clothes were ripped away and his body burst open like an overfilled
  grocery bag, blood and viscera splattering out of his dismembered body in
  unbelievable quantities. A moment later, the entrails were drawn into the
  monster’s body like food getting sucked down into a blender. Marcus saw a
  pale, mauled section of Spencer’s torso briefly surface from the seething
  mass, the meat and skin stretching obscenely as it was torn away from the
  bloody ribs, and a moment later the dripping, red segment of ribcage was
  crushed back down into the mass of fanged tentacles.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus would have vomited again from sheer <i>terror</i> if he’d had the
  capacity to, but for the moment all he could do was try and fail to breathe.
  Where his vision wasn’t blurry from tears, there was blackness fading in
  around the edges, whether from lack of air or oncoming shock from his
  injury.<br />
  <br />
  There were no thoughts of calling for help or fighting back. Marcus only felt
  bone-deep agony and overwhelming, electrifying fear. The need to be somewhere,
  <i>anywhere</i> else paradoxically froze him in place, as if his body had
  overridden his brain and was trying to hide in plain sight or offer abject
  surrender. Spencer had just <i>died, </i>it was unbelievable, it didn’t make
  any <i>sense,</i> this place was supposed to be <i>safe</i>—but Marcus was
  certain that he was next.<br />
  <br />
  The monster was resolving into a humanoid shape again. The thing compressed
  itself, crunching down and ejecting spurts of blood and chunks of gore like a
  squeezed sponge as it shrank down to the size and shape of a human again.
  Marcus felt the hot wetness splatter over him, but didn’t dare blink or look
  away.<br />
  <br />
  In moments, the tentacled thing had molded back together like clay and changed
  color to become the hooded figure once more, clothes and all. It was
  spotlessly clean despite standing in a huge, spreading pool of blood and bits
  of Spencer that cascaded down the short steps and into the alley beyond.<br />
  <br />
  “Damn,” said the monster wearing human skin. “All that and I’m still
  hungry.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus could hardly believe his own ears. The thing sounded mildly
  disappointed, almost <i>bored,</i> like he’d gotten the wrong order at a
  drive-thru.<br />
  <br />
  He killed Spencer and <i>that</i> was all he had to say?<br />
  <br />
  That spark of rage was what finally broke Marcus free from the paralysis of
  terror.<br />
  <br />
  He couldn’t move much, but he saw where Spencer’s Ruger had clattered against
  the wall and fallen nearby. With a desperate adrenaline-fueled lunge that
  ignited the pain in his back, Marcus grabbed the gun and aimed—<br />
  <br />
  There was a blur of motion, a tight feeling in his arm and shoulder. His arm
  moved <i>wrongly,</i> the angles not matching.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus saw his right forearm falling in four pieces from the bloody stump of
  his elbow. Blood fountained from the stump, the warm wetness spreading over
  his shirt. It just felt numb.<br />
  <br />
  looking up, Marcus saw that the monster had transformed its fingers into long,
  thin, scythe-like claws that were almost hypnotic in the effortless,
  quicksilver way they moved, like the swaying of a cobra about to strike. He
  looked away from the claws, and met the thing’s pale, dead eyes. There was no
  anger, no regret, no humanity, just <i>hunger</i>. The thing didn’t even care
  at all that Marcus was a human being, he realized in an instant of
  understanding. It just saw Marcus as an acceptable target.<br />
  <br />
  Then the pain hit in earnest, a searing fire in Marcus’s shoulder and arm. He
  let out what little breath he’d had left in a shuddering moan as he clutched
  the stump close to his chest.<br />
  <br />
  No. No. No. <i>No</i>. This couldn’t be happening. Not here. He had to get
  away...<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tried to move, but he couldn’t. He was too weak. He hurt so, so much,
  he was so tired. All he wanted was to go to sleep, and not have to deal with
  this pain anymore. He wanted to go to sleep and wake up in bed back home, back
  with his family.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus squeezed his eyes shut, tears spilling out. He remembered all the
  stupid arguments he had with his family, how much they begged him to stay home
  and not join the Empire.<br />
  <br />
  <i>I’m sorry, Mom. I’m sorry, Cass.</i><br />
  <br />
  The last thing Marcus felt besides the pain and regret was the sensation of
  being lifted up off the ground.<br />
  <br />
  <b
    >A/N <br />
    Still with me after this chapter? Good. I was really nervous about this one,
    for obvious reasons. Humanizing Nazis and depicting their propaganda is
    always a perilous thing, although it is vitally important to the story to do
    so, for reasons that will become clear later. Needless to say, the opinions
    of the characters do not reflect the author’s, yadda yadda. Marcus is
    supposed to come off as a jumped-up know-nothing wehraboo and a hypocrite,
    but still just a scared, misguided teen underneath. I hope that came
    through.<br />
    <br />
    In other news, I have launched a new contest! It can be found under the
    Apocrypha thread. I can announce here that two prizes have been claimed thus
    far—congratulations again to TheLastOne, who won a bespoke chapter and
    requested a Regent interlude (timing TBD). I must also congratulate the new
    winner, InfiniteTangent, whose correct answer has won everyone a bonus
    chapter coming out this upcoming Tuesday. Thanks to everyone who
    participated! Your guesses are extremely valuable to me, for gauging my
    audience’s expectations!</b

  <b>Infection 2.M</b><br />
  <br />
  Marcus lounged in the Eagle’s Nest, slowly sinking into one of the bar’s
  comfortable leather couches. He was nursing his second tall glass of beer that
  night, mindful not to let the pleasant buzz muddle his thoughts. He wanted his
  mind to stay relatively sharp, but also keep the atmosphere relaxed. Marcus
  was admittedly a lightweight, in more ways than one, and it didn’t take much
  alcohol to get a good buzz going—unlike his best friend Spencer, who sat in a
  matching armchair to his left.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer charitably described himself as ‘husky,’ in stark contrast to Marcus,
  and as a result Spencer could pound away drinks all night long and barely show
  it. He was currently demolishing a fourth beer. That was fine, since he wasn’t
  here to do the talking anyway. Spencer was around more to provide Marcus moral
  support and, admittedly, to complement him with a more normal and less serious
  side of things. It had been Spencer’s idea to invite the third member of their
  little group.<br />
  <br />
  On Marcus’s right sat Seth, the younger brother of an old high school friend
  of Spencer’s. Seth might have been okay with drinking alongside Spencer and
  Marcus—at least partly because he couldn’t get easy access to booze anywhere
  else—but he wasn’t a member of the Empire Eighty-Eight like Spencer and Marcus
  were. Marcus hoped to change that tonight. He had been noticed for his budding
  talent at changing minds, having brought two other members into the Empire in
  just six months, and adding a third would help him move up in the
  organization.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tended to prefer the deep and serious approach to recruitment, but
  Spencer was good at just making friends. He often reminded Marcus of a dog, in
  both good and bad ways. Spencer was friendly, silly, and a bit too fond of
  food, but he was brave and loyal when it counted the most. Marcus couldn’t
  have asked for a better friend, or a better partner in crime to try winning
  over hearts and minds. Spencer could handle the heart, while Marcus would
  target the mind.<br />
  <br />
  Seth had started out nervous when he’d entered the bar, but with the help of
  Spencer’s happy-go-lucky teasing and antics, he’d mellowed out considerably.
  That was good—it would make the next part easier.<br />
  <br />
  “What’s with the dopey smile?” Spencer asked Marcus.<br />
  <br />
  “Just thinkin’ about days gone by. You know. High school. How glad I am to put
  that shit behind me,” said Marcus, smirking at Seth before taking another sip
  of beer.<br />
  <br />
  “Yeah, man. Ancient history,” Seth responded with heavy irony, conveniently
  ignoring that he was 17 and still a senior at Winslow High.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer snorted. “Oh, fuck off with your <i>ancient history</i>. If it weren’t
  for us vouching for you, Liza would have tossed you out on your ass for
  showing up with that two-bit fake I.D.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth gestured at Marcus. “He’s only one grade ahead of me, why aren’t you
  getting on <i>his</i> case?”<br />
  <br />
  “It’s not about drinking age, it’s about who you <i>know</i>. Marcus and I are
  members of the club. You’re just our guest,” Spencer said sagely.<br />
  <br />
  “Come on, Spence,” Marcus gently chided. “He’s just here to relax and have a
  good time. This isn’t a members-only bar.”<br />
  <br />
  Spencer scoffed. “Like hell it isn’t! Look around, do you see
  <i>anyone</i> who’s not white?”<br />
  <br />
  “It’s more than just that. If all they did was keep out Merchants and homeless
  trash, that would be kind of a low bar,” Marcus pointed out.<br />
  <br />
  “Pun intended, right? You get weird when you drink, I ever tell you that? All
  serious and philly-<i>philosophical</i>. It’s fuckin’... nerdy as shit.”
  Spencer said, stumbling a bit over his words.<br />
  <br />
  “Whereas <i>you</i> get all tongue-tied,” Marcus deadpanned.<br />
  <br />
  “I’ll have you know I’m fluent in sign language too, jackass.” said Spencer,
  flipping Marcus the bird and then launching into an elaborate pantomime with a
  lot of pointing and unintelligible arm-chopping motions.<br />
  <br />
  “The hell are you even doing?” Seth laughed.<br />
  <br />
  “Lettin’ Marcus know he’s a sad little stick-in-the-mud.” said Spencer,
  stopping his wild gestures.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shrugged. Spencer’s teasing had long since stopped making him feel
  offended, not when he knew Spencer wasn’t really serious and tried to insult
  just about everyone he thought he could get away with.<br />
  <br />
  “Come on, you fuckin’ <i>lump</i>. Don’t you at least wanna play pool or
  something?” Spencer wheedled. He could be surprisingly shrewish for a guy with
  a beer belly and deep baritone voice.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus rolled his eyes. “Even <i>sober</i> you couldn’t hit the broad side of
  a barn, much less a billiard ball. Maybe try your luck with Landon over there,
  he looks like he can barely stand. If you can beat him, get back to me.”<br />
  <br />
  Spencer stood up and walked off, muttering. “I dunno why I hang around with
  such a stuck-up little toothpick.”<br />
  <br />
  Chuckling at his friend, Marcus settled back, relaxing. He let the sounds of
  the room wash over him, the charging beat of the rock music playing at medium
  volume in the background, the murmur of the crowd, the clink of glasses and
  silverware. He loved relaxing at the Eagle’s Nest. It was a safe haven full of
  simple pleasures, a stress-free environment compared to the howling goddamn
  insanity that was Brockton Bay.<br />
  <br />
  Seth, however, was fidgeting and seemed quite restless. His fear at being
  busted for underage drinking had evaporated, but he still looked like he
  didn’t quite know what to do with himself in this place where he stuck out
  like a sore thumb. He was the only one in the whole bar with shoulder-length
  brown hair, everyone else was either a natural or dyed blonde like Marcus, or
  a skinhead like Spencer.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus waited patiently. The topic of the Empire’s ideology was going to come
  up eventually. People didn’t listen when you tried to shove your worldview
  down their throats, they just got defensive and shut down, he knew that much
  from bitter experience with his mom and sister. If you just left the door open
  and answered their questions, though, they’d be a lot more receptive to what
  you had to say.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus’s gaze fell on the elaborately wrought iron eagle mounted in the corner
  near the ceiling, holding the corners of two flags in its claws. One was the
  Imperial German war ensign, the other an Iron Cross on a black background. It
  made Marcus feel a warm flush of pride.<br />
  <br />
  “Hey, Marcus. What are you thinking about?” Seth finally asked.<br />
  <br />
  “Just appreciating the vexillolography,” Marcus said, nodding at the flag.<br />
  <br />
  “Gesundheit,” said Seth, raising an eyebrow.<br />
  <br />
  “It means the art of the flags. There’s a lot of meaning behind every element
  in the colors and symbols.” Marcus said.<br />
  <br />
  “I’ve been meaning to ask you about that—not the flag, I mean, but all the
  Nazi stuff. Like, I know the Nazis had some cool shit and all, but I don’t get
  why you and your, uh, <i>friends</i> are all gung-ho about them. You’re not
  even German.” Seth pointed out.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus chuckled, leaning forward. “You know, I’m <i>so</i> glad you asked
  about the <i>good news...!”</i> he said with mock brightness, doing his best
  door-knocking evangelist impression.<br />
  <br />
  “Oh, God, spare me the sales pitch. Forget I said anything!” said Seth,
  covering his eyes.<br />
  <br />
  They both laughed together, in that un-self-conscious way that only partially
  inebriated people could manage.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned back, sighing after the laughing fit passed. “Seriously, though,
  dude. I won’t push, but do you really want to know?”<br />
  <br />
  Seth shrugged. “I mean, kinda? I’ve always been more interested in the biker
  and metalhead scenes, but if you hang out around those long enough, you pick
  up a thing or two. I don’t really get it, though. I mean, don’t get me wrong,
  I hate those ABB motherfuckers, but I don’t get the jump from that to, like,
  full-on Nazis.”<br />
  <br />
  “I think you understand more than you think,” Marcus said, holding up a hand.
  “Maybe it’ll help to give you an example. For me, I started coming around when
  I began noticing that something was really wrong with the world.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth scoffed. “There’s a <i>lot</i> wrong with the world. There’s wars and
  Endbringers and the Water Crisis and all that shit.”<br />
  <br />
  “I mean besides the obvious. There’s something rotten with
  <i>normal</i> people, the way they think and act. You know, just culture in
  general,” Marcus pressed, waving a finger in a circle as if to encompass the
  whole world. “Didn’t everything seem so much more hopeful when we were kids? I
  mean, we were both born after the Golden Age of Superheroes ended, but things
  weren’t so bad on the surface. Behemoth came around before I could really
  remember, but people didn’t really know what that had <i>meant</i> yet. Do you
  remember when Jörmungandr first appeared?”<br />
  <br />
  “Who?” asked Seth, his brow knitting in confusion.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned in closer, quietly listing off the names of the beast.
  “Jörmungandr. The Second. The Serpent. <i>Leviathan</i>.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus saw a spark of interest in Seth’s eyes, and knew he’d hit pay dirt, a
  true connection. The truth that can only be uncovered by shared experience.<br />
  <br />
  “I do,” Seth said, his voice coming out hushed, subconsciously mirroring
  Marcus’ own serious tone. “What’s that got to do with Nazis, though?”<br />
  <br />
  <i>“Everything,”</i> Marcus said, spreading his arms wide. “It’s all
  connected. I’ll tell you the story, if you like.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth still looked a little skeptical, but he’d picked up on Marcus’s serious
  mood. He nodded solemnly.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus mentally girded himself, disciplining his thoughts into order. It was
  hard being a recruiter. He had to bare his soul and confront some heavy shit,
  the dark truths that everyone knew but preferred to ignore. And he had to do
  all that with total conviction and confidence, without flinching away from the
  uncomfortable parts. It opened Marcus up to mockery or attacks or joking
  deflections, but it was necessary. People could sense insincerity a mile away.
  He had to make himself vulnerable to be believed, then build that connection
  up into something strong.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus took a deep breath, and began his story.<br />
  <br />
  “One of my earliest memories was watching TV with my big sister, some cartoon
  or something. Suddenly, the movie cut out, and it started showing the news, so
  my sister tried changing the channel, but it was all the same thing on
  <i>every</i> channel, talking about Jörmungandr appearing for the first time.
  I was just a little kid, I didn’t know what was going on, and Cass wouldn’t
  tell me, so I called out to Mom. She came into the living room, and then she
  just <i>froze</i>. I don’t really remember what the news was saying, but I’ll
  never forget the look on her face. How she went all still and white. Seeing my
  mom, standing there like a statue, just... I could tell she was rooted by pure
  <i>fear, </i>and it scared me more than anything I’d ever seen in my life.
  Then she grabbed both of us, hugging us so hard it <i>hurt,</i> and even
  though she couldn’t stop <i>crying,</i> she still didn’t look away from the
  TV, not even once. We didn’t understand what happened, but it was mom’s
  reaction that made it <i>real</i>. After that, I saw the despair everywhere,
  but I didn’t understand it, what that really <i>meant</i> for the world, not
  until years later.”<br />
  <br />
  As Marcus spoke, he felt chills racing down his body, goosebumps rippling out
  over his arms at reliving the memory.<br />
  <br />
  “Are you talking about Leviathan being the reason for the boat graveyard, and
  the city’s economy getting fucked up?” Seth asked as Marcus took a drink to
  soothe his suddenly dry throat.<br />
  <br />
  “That’s only a tiny part of it. <i>Everything</i> went downhill from there,
  <i>everywhere</i>. You and I, our generation, we could feel it even when we
  were kids, and growing up it only got worse. Think about it—when Jörmungandr
  sank Kyushu, that’s when all the immigrants started flooding in. Not just in
  Brockton Bay with the ABB turning the place into a shithole, there’s
  <i>millions</i> of refugees all over, and it’s only going to get a thousand
  times worse in a few years. So what’s <i>wrong</i> with people? They’re all
  <i>terrified, </i>but they’re pretending that they aren’t. People are too busy
  with sports or celebrities or drugs or whatever pointless, petty bullshit they
  use to distract themselves from thinking.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth nodded. “Oh yeah. It’s all total bullshit, we can agree on that part.
  People would rather have their comfortable lies instead of the hard truth. I
  don’t sign on to all the race stuff, though.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus felt his cheeks flush a little with his frustration, and hoped it
  didn’t show. The pitch had started well, but now it felt like he was losing
  Seth, so he decided to go for one of his trump cards. “About the race stuff, I
  get it. I do. We’ve been taught from birth it’s bad. Kumbaya and give peace a
  chance and all that shit the mass media pushes to keep everyone in line. But
  you can just as easily say <i>fighting</i> is bad. There’s no room for that
  out in the <i>real</i> world, where things like fighting and racism are
  sometimes <i>necessary</i>. I’ve heard it explained this way, and it really
  stuck with me: think of the world like a sinking ship. Your country—as in,
  your culture, that’s the lifeboat.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth raised a skeptical eyebrow. “So you’re saying we’re like the
  <i>Titanic</i>, and the Jews are like the iceberg or something?”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shook his head, resisting the urge to call out Seth’s stupidity. “No,
  not at all. What I mean is, the ship’s like the world, and it’s already
  sinking, there’s nothing we can do to stop it now. Think of white culture as
  the last lifeboat. Everyone knows it’s their best chance, so everyone’s
  flocking to it. But if too many people try to climb on the lifeboat, they’ll
  sink the whole thing for everyone. Sure, you can give up your spot on the boat
  if you want to be <i>nice</i> or whatever, but then you’re just, y’know,
  adding to the problem, because the guy you let on wants to bring
  <i>his</i> family, <i>his</i> friends, and now suddenly everyone’s fighting
  each other instead of defending the boat. The lifeboat sinks, everyone dies,
  and <i>nobody</i> is better off just because you did the ‘nice’ thing. In
  order to survive, we have to <i>fight,</i> and to fight we have to be united
  by something stronger. A shared culture, shared blood. I know no one
  <i>else</i> is going to fight for me, all the other races only ever stick up
  for themselves. So why shouldn’t we?”<br />
  <br />
  Seth shrugged helplessly. “Look, I’m all for protecting my own culture. I
  don’t have any problem with that, and I’m proud to be white too. It’s a good
  thing, right? I don’t know what else to tell you, though. All the Asians can
  fuck right off back to where they came from, but I don’t see the point of
  being so hung up over the blacks and gays and Jews. It just seems... kinda
  pointless, you know?”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shook his head. “I’m sorry if it’s hard to accept, but including blacks
  and gays and whatever else is a luxury we just can’t <i>afford</i>. Black
  people and their problems are a liability in this fight, you don’t have to
  hate them, but that’s just a <i>fact</i>. They’re less than 13% of the
  population, but they commit the majority of the crimes. White people have an
  IQ of 100 and black people have an IQ of 80. That’s just the truth, and it
  won’t change for anybody’s politically correct <i>bullshit</i>. It’s just
  nature, and it’s nobody’s <i>fault,</i> but whose fault it is doesn’t matter.
  What matters is <i>survival,</i> and I’m sorry, but you’re not gonna survive
  if you rely on black people or gay people. Just look at Africa. Just look at
  the Roman Empire.”<br />
  <br />
  “No, no, no. I get that part, but I just... does it <i>have</i> to be all
  swastikas and Sieg heils and shit? I mean, no offense, but like, it seems like
  you’re going too far in the other direction. This isn’t Germany in the ‘30s.
  It feels like you’re all trying to dress up for Halloween or something,” said
  Seth, looking pointedly at the guy at the bar with a swastika tattoo on his
  neck.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus waved his hand dismissively. “What, the symbols and all that? It’s just
  ways for people to rebel, or support their favorite capes in the Empire. The
  symbolism is our way of saying <i>fuck the system. </i>It’s about reclaiming
  our heritage from all the lies and bullshit, and some people...” Marcus
  gestured at Spencer’s iron cross-decorated jacket before continuing, “...Just
  like that it drives the fuckers nuts.”<br />
  <br />
  “Okay, that’s fine, I guess, I’m not against free speech or whatever.” Seth
  said sulkily, taking a swig of his beer.<br />
  <br />
  Nodding equably, Marcus tried to steer things back on track. “Letting people
  just do their own thing is okay when things are good, but we’ve
  <i>tried</i> mashing people from different cultures together, and it just
  <i>doesn’t work</i>. We need to try something else.”<br />
  <br />
  “Man, come on. It’s not like the Nazis had the best track record either, they
  did some pretty fucked up shit too.” said Seth, chuckling dryly. “Like, even
  if all you said was true, killing all the Jews or whatever just doesn’t seem
  like it would <i>help</i> anything, just make things even worse.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus felt a flash of indignation at the jibe. It was genuinely disturbing to
  hear all the old fallacies and talking points trotted out robotically, almost
  verbatim. The sheep <i>always</i> brought it around to the Holocaust, every
  single time.<br />
  <br />
  “History is written by the victors, you know that. You’ve got to think for
  <i>yourself,”</i> Marcus said, the words coming out more snidely than he
  intended. He took a quick, calming breath, and continued in a more mellow
  tone, “Allied propaganda only gets a pass because they won in the end.
  Nowadays, people think of fascism like this one-sided, cartoonish thing, just
  bad guys for Indiana Jones and Uncle Sam to punch. When normal people think of
  Nazis, they think of black-and-white newsreels with Hitler speaking
  passionately in German—but haven’t you ever noticed they never include any
  subtitles? God forbid people hear a translation, or else they might end up
  <i>agreeing</i> with him.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth frowned. “I mean, I’ve never been that into history. I guess I never
  thought about getting the other side of the story,” he conceded.<br />
  <br />
  “Well, don’t just take <i>my</i> word for it,” Marcus said quickly, sensing an
  opportunity. “You should do your own research. You might be surprised by what
  you find. Bottom line, though, the world is in desperate need of
  <i>real</i> heroes and warriors who’ll fight for what’s right.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth sighed, sagging down in his chair, holding his drink between his knees.
  “I dunno, man. You’re right that the world’s fucked, but it feels like you’re
  just getting your hopes up.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned back and smiled. “Look around. You just see a couple of guys
  talking in a bar, right? But don’t underestimate that. The Nazi Party in
  Germany started out as a bunch of passionate guys in a beer hall in Munich,
  and only ten years later they united their country, then they created one of
  the greatest war machines to ever exist. The only reason Germany lost was
  because they were badly outnumbered. Now it it’s starting again, here, in the
  United States, the most powerful country in the world, and this time, we have
  parahumans that level the—”<br />
  <br />
  “There you are, ranting about history <i>again,”</i> Spencer interrupted as he
  walked up from behind Marcus, putting his hands on Marcus’s shoulders and
  shooting a smile at Seth. “I swear, when we’re not drinkin’ or kickin’ Chink
  ass, this nerd’s got his head stuck in some old history book. He’ll talk your
  ear off if you’re not careful.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tilted his head far back to see Spencer. “Did you lose already?”<br />
  <br />
  “Nah, just wanted a smoke break. Liza’ll tan my hide if I light up in here.
  Wanna come with?” Spencer asked, already rummaging for the pack in his jacket
  pockets.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus cocked his head, considering. Seth didn’t smoke, so he wouldn’t be
  joining them, but it would probably be best to let Seth stew on Marcus’s words
  for a bit anyway. “Eh, sure. I could go for one.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus got up and followed Spencer out the door. Rudy and Liza didn’t
  appreciate people smoking out front—both of them were health nuts that hated
  secondhand smoke—so they’d set up a semi-enclosed little stoop in the side
  alley for smokers, with an overhang to ward away the rain and a pair of
  standing ashtrays.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer lit up a cig, and offered Marcus one with the lighter.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus lit his own, and took a lazy drag. Spencer didn’t buy the best
  cigarettes, but at least he avoided the cheapest shit available.<br />
  <br />
  Taking another drag, Marcus tried his best to savor the rich smoke despite the
  chilly night air. He was just about to take another pull when he heard a loud
  <i>thump</i> from nearby, making him cough in surprise.<br />
  <br />
  There was a shuffling sound in the alley, down on the side with the dead end.
  Someone was there the whole time? Marcus peered into the darkness, but it was
  almost impossible to see beyond the cone of wan, yellow light cast by the
  single bulb installed in the overhang. Marcus saw the guy in the shadows
  first, and lightly slapped Spencer’s shoulder, pointing his friend towards the
  newcomer. It was a guy in a hoodie.<br />
  <br />
  "The fuck d’you want?" Spencer asked, a bit muffled from the cigarette he held
  in his lips.<br />
  <br />
  "Are you two Empire Eighty-Eight?” the hooded man asked tersely. He was
  fidgeting and trembling uncontrollably, which Marcus immediately pegged as
  drug withdrawal. As the man stepped closer to the light, Marcus could see he
  had that unmistakable hungry look to him, but he was also wearing Empire
  colors.<br />
  <br />
  That gave Marcus pause, but his confusion resolved as quickly as it had
  arisen. This dude was clearly one of the Merchant’s degenerates, probably
  trying to pick a fight or dress up as one of them and steal some drugs or
  something. The dumbass had picked the <i>worst</i> possible place to do it,
  though.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus and Spencer exchanged a skeptical look before refocusing on the
  junkie.<br />
  <br />
  "Yeah, we’re Empire—but just coming right up and asking, that’s a first," said
  Spencer, smiling humorlessly. "But this ain’t a fuckin’ charity. We don’t give
  freebies to losers on the street just ‘cause they’re white. Fuck off.”<br />
  <br />
  The hoodie guy said nothing, his gaze hawkish and intense. Marcus felt his
  stomach tense at the creepy look in the hooded man’s eyes. He moved closer,
  striding right towards them.<br />
  <br />
  Was this guy for <i>real?</i> He must have been jonesing <i>hard</i> to think
  taking on two-on-one odds was a good idea, even without the gun.<br />
  <br />
  “You asked for it, motherfucker,” Spencer snarled, reaching into his jacket
  and pulling out his huge Ruger Blackhawk revolver. The dark gray metal made it
  almost impossible to see in the dark, but the menacing shape of Spencer’s
  beloved .357 magnum would be unmistakable, even to a junkie.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus didn’t even have time to register what the hooded man was doing when
  his left hand slapped the gun out of Spencer’s grip before he could even cock
  the hammer. In nearly the same instant, the hooded man’s right hand seized
  Spencer by the neck, then he kicked Marcus in the gut with a visceral
  <i>crunch</i> that radiated through Marcus’s whole body. Pain exploded in his
  midsection as he was lifted off his feet by the force of the blow, his back
  slamming into the concrete ashtray and sending him spinning into the
  ground.<br />
  <br />
  After a moment of disorientation, with blinding stars dancing in Marcus’s
  vision, the pain truly hit in full, and he couldn’t even <i>breathe</i>. It
  felt like he’d been broken in <i>half</i>. His stomach and back radiated with
  pure, overwhelming agony, and he curled up on his side, his beers and
  hamburger coming back up, the bitter acid and alcohol burning his throat and
  sinuses.<br />
  <br />
  After the brief convulsion of vomiting ended, Marcus struggled to take the
  smallest of breaths. He blinked the stars out of his streaming eyes only to
  watch as the guy in the hoodie—<i>the unmasked cape, </i>he realized—lifted
  Spencer off his feet by the neck.<br />
  <br />
  The parahuman didn’t even flinch as Spencer flailed and struggled, punching
  his face and clawing at his icy blue eyes. Then, the parahuman’s arms
  <i>transformed</i> somehow, sprouting into a mass of dark, jagged cables that
  stabbed into Spencer’s body, dragging him into the monster whose entire upper
  body split apart into a flurry of countless lashing blades.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer was <i>shredded</i>.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer’s clothes were ripped away and his body burst open like an overfilled
  grocery bag, blood and viscera splattering out of his dismembered body in
  unbelievable quantities. A moment later, the entrails were drawn into the
  monster’s body like food getting sucked down into a blender. Marcus saw a
  pale, mauled section of Spencer’s torso briefly surface from the seething
  mass, the meat and skin stretching obscenely as it was torn away from the
  bloody ribs, and a moment later the dripping, red segment of ribcage was
  crushed back down into the mass of fanged tentacles.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus would have vomited again from sheer <i>terror</i> if he’d had the
  capacity to, but for the moment all he could do was try and fail to breathe.
  Where his vision wasn’t blurry from tears, there was blackness fading in
  around the edges, whether from lack of air or oncoming shock from his
  injury.<br />
  <br />
  There were no thoughts of calling for help or fighting back. Marcus only felt
  bone-deep agony and overwhelming, electrifying fear. The need to be somewhere,
  <i>anywhere</i> else paradoxically froze him in place, as if his body had
  overridden his brain and was trying to hide in plain sight or offer abject
  surrender. Spencer had just <i>died, </i>it was unbelievable, it didn’t make
  any <i>sense,</i> this place was supposed to be <i>safe</i>—but Marcus was
  certain that he was next.<br />
  <br />
  The monster was resolving into a humanoid shape again. The thing compressed
  itself, crunching down and ejecting spurts of blood and chunks of gore like a
  squeezed sponge as it shrank down to the size and shape of a human again.
  Marcus felt the hot wetness splatter over him, but didn’t dare blink or look
  away.<br />
  <br />
  In moments, the tentacled thing had molded back together like clay and changed
  color to become the hooded figure once more, clothes and all. It was
  spotlessly clean despite standing in a huge, spreading pool of blood and bits
  of Spencer that cascaded down the short steps and into the alley beyond.<br />
  <br />
  “Damn,” said the monster wearing human skin. “All that and I’m still
  hungry.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus could hardly believe his own ears. The thing sounded mildly
  disappointed, almost <i>bored,</i> like he’d gotten the wrong order at a
  drive-thru.<br />
  <br />
  He killed Spencer and <i>that</i> was all he had to say?<br />
  <br />
  That spark of rage was what finally broke Marcus free from the paralysis of
  terror.<br />
  <br />
  He couldn’t move much, but he saw where Spencer’s Ruger had clattered against
  the wall and fallen nearby. With a desperate adrenaline-fueled lunge that
  ignited the pain in his back, Marcus grabbed the gun and aimed—<br />
  <br />
  There was a blur of motion, a tight feeling in his arm and shoulder. His arm
  moved <i>wrongly,</i> the angles not matching.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus saw his right forearm falling in four pieces from the bloody stump of
  his elbow. Blood fountained from the stump, the warm wetness spreading over
  his shirt. It just felt numb.<br />
  <br />
  looking up, Marcus saw that the monster had transformed its fingers into long,
  thin, scythe-like claws that were almost hypnotic in the effortless,
  quicksilver way they moved, like the swaying of a cobra about to strike. He
  looked away from the claws, and met the thing’s pale, dead eyes. There was no
  anger, no regret, no humanity, just <i>hunger</i>. The thing didn’t even care
  at all that Marcus was a human being, he realized in an instant of
  understanding. It just saw Marcus as an acceptable target.<br />
  <br />
  Then the pain hit in earnest, a searing fire in Marcus’s shoulder and arm. He
  let out what little breath he’d had left in a shuddering moan as he clutched
  the stump close to his chest.<br />
  <br />
  No. No. No. <i>No</i>. This couldn’t be happening. Not here. He had to get
  away...<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tried to move, but he couldn’t. He was too weak. He hurt so, so much,
  he was so tired. All he wanted was to go to sleep, and not have to deal with
  this pain anymore. He wanted to go to sleep and wake up in bed back home, back
  with his family.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus squeezed his eyes shut, tears spilling out. He remembered all the
  stupid arguments he had with his family, how much they begged him to stay home
  and not join the Empire.<br />
  <br />
  <i>I’m sorry, Mom. I’m sorry, Cass.</i><br />
  <br />
  The last thing Marcus felt besides the pain and regret was the sensation of
  being lifted up off the ground.<br />
  <br />
  <b
    >A/N <br />
    Still with me after this chapter? Good. I was really nervous about this one,
    for obvious reasons. Humanizing Nazis and depicting their propaganda is
    always a perilous thing, although it is vitally important to the story to do
    so, for reasons that will become clear later. Needless to say, the opinions
    of the characters do not reflect the author’s, yadda yadda. Marcus is
    supposed to come off as a jumped-up know-nothing wehraboo and a hypocrite,
    but still just a scared, misguided teen underneath. I hope that came
    through.<br />
    <br />
    In other news, I have launched a new contest! It can be found under the
    Apocrypha thread. I can announce here that two prizes have been claimed thus
    far—congratulations again to TheLastOne, who won a bespoke chapter and
    requested a Regent interlude (timing TBD). I must also congratulate the new

  <b>Infection 2.M</b><br />
  <br />
  Marcus lounged in the Eagle’s Nest, slowly sinking into one of the bar’s
  comfortable leather couches. He was nursing his second tall glass of beer that
  night, mindful not to let the pleasant buzz muddle his thoughts. He wanted his
  mind to stay relatively sharp, but also keep the atmosphere relaxed. Marcus
  was admittedly a lightweight, in more ways than one, and it didn’t take much
  alcohol to get a good buzz going—unlike his best friend Spencer, who sat in a
  matching armchair to his left.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer charitably described himself as ‘husky,’ in stark contrast to Marcus,
  and as a result Spencer could pound away drinks all night long and barely show
  it. He was currently demolishing a fourth beer. That was fine, since he wasn’t
  here to do the talking anyway. Spencer was around more to provide Marcus moral
  support and, admittedly, to complement him with a more normal and less serious
  side of things. It had been Spencer’s idea to invite the third member of their
  little group.<br />
  <br />
  On Marcus’s right sat Seth, the younger brother of an old high school friend
  of Spencer’s. Seth might have been okay with drinking alongside Spencer and
  Marcus—at least partly because he couldn’t get easy access to booze anywhere
  else—but he wasn’t a member of the Empire Eighty-Eight like Spencer and Marcus
  were. Marcus hoped to change that tonight. He had been noticed for his budding
  talent at changing minds, having brought two other members into the Empire in
  just six months, and adding a third would help him move up in the
  organization.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tended to prefer the deep and serious approach to recruitment, but
  Spencer was good at just making friends. He often reminded Marcus of a dog, in
  both good and bad ways. Spencer was friendly, silly, and a bit too fond of
  food, but he was brave and loyal when it counted the most. Marcus couldn’t
  have asked for a better friend, or a better partner in crime to try winning
  over hearts and minds. Spencer could handle the heart, while Marcus would
  target the mind.<br />
  <br />
  Seth had started out nervous when he’d entered the bar, but with the help of
  Spencer’s happy-go-lucky teasing and antics, he’d mellowed out considerably.
  That was good—it would make the next part easier.<br />
  <br />
  “What’s with the dopey smile?” Spencer asked Marcus.<br />
  <br />
  “Just thinkin’ about days gone by. You know. High school. How glad I am to put
  that shit behind me,” said Marcus, smirking at Seth before taking another sip
  of beer.<br />
  <br />
  “Yeah, man. Ancient history,” Seth responded with heavy irony, conveniently
  ignoring that he was 17 and still a senior at Winslow High.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer snorted. “Oh, fuck off with your <i>ancient history</i>. If it weren’t
  for us vouching for you, Liza would have tossed you out on your ass for
  showing up with that two-bit fake I.D.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth gestured at Marcus. “He’s only one grade ahead of me, why aren’t you
  getting on <i>his</i> case?”<br />
  <br />
  “It’s not about drinking age, it’s about who you <i>know</i>. Marcus and I are
  members of the club. You’re just our guest,” Spencer said sagely.<br />
  <br />
  “Come on, Spence,” Marcus gently chided. “He’s just here to relax and have a
  good time. This isn’t a members-only bar.”<br />
  <br />
  Spencer scoffed. “Like hell it isn’t! Look around, do you see
  <i>anyone</i> who’s not white?”<br />
  <br />
  “It’s more than just that. If all they did was keep out Merchants and homeless
  trash, that would be kind of a low bar,” Marcus pointed out.<br />
  <br />
  “Pun intended, right? You get weird when you drink, I ever tell you that? All
  serious and philly-<i>philosophical</i>. It’s fuckin’... nerdy as shit.”
  Spencer said, stumbling a bit over his words.<br />
  <br />
  “Whereas <i>you</i> get all tongue-tied,” Marcus deadpanned.<br />
  <br />
  “I’ll have you know I’m fluent in sign language too, jackass.” said Spencer,
  flipping Marcus the bird and then launching into an elaborate pantomime with a
  lot of pointing and unintelligible arm-chopping motions.<br />
  <br />
  “The hell are you even doing?” Seth laughed.<br />
  <br />
  “Lettin’ Marcus know he’s a sad little stick-in-the-mud.” said Spencer,
  stopping his wild gestures.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shrugged. Spencer’s teasing had long since stopped making him feel
  offended, not when he knew Spencer wasn’t really serious and tried to insult
  just about everyone he thought he could get away with.<br />
  <br />
  “Come on, you fuckin’ <i>lump</i>. Don’t you at least wanna play pool or
  something?” Spencer wheedled. He could be surprisingly shrewish for a guy with
  a beer belly and deep baritone voice.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus rolled his eyes. “Even <i>sober</i> you couldn’t hit the broad side of
  a barn, much less a billiard ball. Maybe try your luck with Landon over there,
  he looks like he can barely stand. If you can beat him, get back to me.”<br />
  <br />
  Spencer stood up and walked off, muttering. “I dunno why I hang around with
  such a stuck-up little toothpick.”<br />
  <br />
  Chuckling at his friend, Marcus settled back, relaxing. He let the sounds of
  the room wash over him, the charging beat of the rock music playing at medium
  volume in the background, the murmur of the crowd, the clink of glasses and
  silverware. He loved relaxing at the Eagle’s Nest. It was a safe haven full of
  simple pleasures, a stress-free environment compared to the howling goddamn
  insanity that was Brockton Bay.<br />
  <br />
  Seth, however, was fidgeting and seemed quite restless. His fear at being
  busted for underage drinking had evaporated, but he still looked like he
  didn’t quite know what to do with himself in this place where he stuck out
  like a sore thumb. He was the only one in the whole bar with shoulder-length
  brown hair, everyone else was either a natural or dyed blonde like Marcus, or
  a skinhead like Spencer.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus waited patiently. The topic of the Empire’s ideology was going to come
  up eventually. People didn’t listen when you tried to shove your worldview
  down their throats, they just got defensive and shut down, he knew that much
  from bitter experience with his mom and sister. If you just left the door open
  and answered their questions, though, they’d be a lot more receptive to what
  you had to say.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus’s gaze fell on the elaborately wrought iron eagle mounted in the corner
  near the ceiling, holding the corners of two flags in its claws. One was the
  Imperial German war ensign, the other an Iron Cross on a black background. It
  made Marcus feel a warm flush of pride.<br />
  <br />
  “Hey, Marcus. What are you thinking about?” Seth finally asked.<br />
  <br />
  “Just appreciating the vexillolography,” Marcus said, nodding at the flag.<br />
  <br />
  “Gesundheit,” said Seth, raising an eyebrow.<br />
  <br />
  “It means the art of the flags. There’s a lot of meaning behind every element
  in the colors and symbols.” Marcus said.<br />
  <br />
  “I’ve been meaning to ask you about that—not the flag, I mean, but all the
  Nazi stuff. Like, I know the Nazis had some cool shit and all, but I don’t get
  why you and your, uh, <i>friends</i> are all gung-ho about them. You’re not
  even German.” Seth pointed out.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus chuckled, leaning forward. “You know, I’m <i>so</i> glad you asked
  about the <i>good news...!”</i> he said with mock brightness, doing his best
  door-knocking evangelist impression.<br />
  <br />
  “Oh, God, spare me the sales pitch. Forget I said anything!” said Seth,
  covering his eyes.<br />
  <br />
  They both laughed together, in that un-self-conscious way that only partially
  inebriated people could manage.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned back, sighing after the laughing fit passed. “Seriously, though,
  dude. I won’t push, but do you really want to know?”<br />
  <br />
  Seth shrugged. “I mean, kinda? I’ve always been more interested in the biker
  and metalhead scenes, but if you hang out around those long enough, you pick
  up a thing or two. I don’t really get it, though. I mean, don’t get me wrong,
  I hate those ABB motherfuckers, but I don’t get the jump from that to, like,
  full-on Nazis.”<br />
  <br />
  “I think you understand more than you think,” Marcus said, holding up a hand.
  “Maybe it’ll help to give you an example. For me, I started coming around when
  I began noticing that something was really wrong with the world.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth scoffed. “There’s a <i>lot</i> wrong with the world. There’s wars and
  Endbringers and the Water Crisis and all that shit.”<br />
  <br />
  “I mean besides the obvious. There’s something rotten with
  <i>normal</i> people, the way they think and act. You know, just culture in
  general,” Marcus pressed, waving a finger in a circle as if to encompass the
  whole world. “Didn’t everything seem so much more hopeful when we were kids? I
  mean, we were both born after the Golden Age of Superheroes ended, but things
  weren’t so bad on the surface. Behemoth came around before I could really
  remember, but people didn’t really know what that had <i>meant</i> yet. Do you
  remember when Jörmungandr first appeared?”<br />
  <br />
  “Who?” asked Seth, his brow knitting in confusion.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned in closer, quietly listing off the names of the beast.
  “Jörmungandr. The Second. The Serpent. <i>Leviathan</i>.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus saw a spark of interest in Seth’s eyes, and knew he’d hit pay dirt, a
  true connection. The truth that can only be uncovered by shared experience.<br />
  <br />
  “I do,” Seth said, his voice coming out hushed, subconsciously mirroring
  Marcus’ own serious tone. “What’s that got to do with Nazis, though?”<br />
  <br />
  <i>“Everything,”</i> Marcus said, spreading his arms wide. “It’s all
  connected. I’ll tell you the story, if you like.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth still looked a little skeptical, but he’d picked up on Marcus’s serious
  mood. He nodded solemnly.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus mentally girded himself, disciplining his thoughts into order. It was
  hard being a recruiter. He had to bare his soul and confront some heavy shit,
  the dark truths that everyone knew but preferred to ignore. And he had to do
  all that with total conviction and confidence, without flinching away from the
  uncomfortable parts. It opened Marcus up to mockery or attacks or joking
  deflections, but it was necessary. People could sense insincerity a mile away.
  He had to make himself vulnerable to be believed, then build that connection
  up into something strong.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus took a deep breath, and began his story.<br />
  <br />
  “One of my earliest memories was watching TV with my big sister, some cartoon
  or something. Suddenly, the movie cut out, and it started showing the news, so
  my sister tried changing the channel, but it was all the same thing on
  <i>every</i> channel, talking about Jörmungandr appearing for the first time.
  I was just a little kid, I didn’t know what was going on, and Cass wouldn’t
  tell me, so I called out to Mom. She came into the living room, and then she
  just <i>froze</i>. I don’t really remember what the news was saying, but I’ll
  never forget the look on her face. How she went all still and white. Seeing my
  mom, standing there like a statue, just... I could tell she was rooted by pure
  <i>fear, </i>and it scared me more than anything I’d ever seen in my life.
  Then she grabbed both of us, hugging us so hard it <i>hurt,</i> and even
  though she couldn’t stop <i>crying,</i> she still didn’t look away from the
  TV, not even once. We didn’t understand what happened, but it was mom’s
  reaction that made it <i>real</i>. After that, I saw the despair everywhere,
  but I didn’t understand it, what that really <i>meant</i> for the world, not
  until years later.”<br />
  <br />
  As Marcus spoke, he felt chills racing down his body, goosebumps rippling out
  over his arms at reliving the memory.<br />
  <br />
  “Are you talking about Leviathan being the reason for the boat graveyard, and
  the city’s economy getting fucked up?” Seth asked as Marcus took a drink to
  soothe his suddenly dry throat.<br />
  <br />
  “That’s only a tiny part of it. <i>Everything</i> went downhill from there,
  <i>everywhere</i>. You and I, our generation, we could feel it even when we
  were kids, and growing up it only got worse. Think about it—when Jörmungandr
  sank Kyushu, that’s when all the immigrants started flooding in. Not just in
  Brockton Bay with the ABB turning the place into a shithole, there’s
  <i>millions</i> of refugees all over, and it’s only going to get a thousand
  times worse in a few years. So what’s <i>wrong</i> with people? They’re all
  <i>terrified, </i>but they’re pretending that they aren’t. People are too busy
  with sports or celebrities or drugs or whatever pointless, petty bullshit they
  use to distract themselves from thinking.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth nodded. “Oh yeah. It’s all total bullshit, we can agree on that part.
  People would rather have their comfortable lies instead of the hard truth. I
  don’t sign on to all the race stuff, though.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus felt his cheeks flush a little with his frustration, and hoped it
  didn’t show. The pitch had started well, but now it felt like he was losing
  Seth, so he decided to go for one of his trump cards. “About the race stuff, I
  get it. I do. We’ve been taught from birth it’s bad. Kumbaya and give peace a
  chance and all that shit the mass media pushes to keep everyone in line. But
  you can just as easily say <i>fighting</i> is bad. There’s no room for that
  out in the <i>real</i> world, where things like fighting and racism are
  sometimes <i>necessary</i>. I’ve heard it explained this way, and it really
  stuck with me: think of the world like a sinking ship. Your country—as in,
  your culture, that’s the lifeboat.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth raised a skeptical eyebrow. “So you’re saying we’re like the
  <i>Titanic</i>, and the Jews are like the iceberg or something?”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shook his head, resisting the urge to call out Seth’s stupidity. “No,
  not at all. What I mean is, the ship’s like the world, and it’s already
  sinking, there’s nothing we can do to stop it now. Think of white culture as
  the last lifeboat. Everyone knows it’s their best chance, so everyone’s
  flocking to it. But if too many people try to climb on the lifeboat, they’ll
  sink the whole thing for everyone. Sure, you can give up your spot on the boat
  if you want to be <i>nice</i> or whatever, but then you’re just, y’know,
  adding to the problem, because the guy you let on wants to bring
  <i>his</i> family, <i>his</i> friends, and now suddenly everyone’s fighting
  each other instead of defending the boat. The lifeboat sinks, everyone dies,
  and <i>nobody</i> is better off just because you did the ‘nice’ thing. In
  order to survive, we have to <i>fight,</i> and to fight we have to be united
  by something stronger. A shared culture, shared blood. I know no one
  <i>else</i> is going to fight for me, all the other races only ever stick up
  for themselves. So why shouldn’t we?”<br />
  <br />
  Seth shrugged helplessly. “Look, I’m all for protecting my own culture. I
  don’t have any problem with that, and I’m proud to be white too. It’s a good
  thing, right? I don’t know what else to tell you, though. All the Asians can
  fuck right off back to where they came from, but I don’t see the point of
  being so hung up over the blacks and gays and Jews. It just seems... kinda
  pointless, you know?”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shook his head. “I’m sorry if it’s hard to accept, but including blacks
  and gays and whatever else is a luxury we just can’t <i>afford</i>. Black
  people and their problems are a liability in this fight, you don’t have to
  hate them, but that’s just a <i>fact</i>. They’re less than 13% of the
  population, but they commit the majority of the crimes. White people have an
  IQ of 100 and black people have an IQ of 80. That’s just the truth, and it
  won’t change for anybody’s politically correct <i>bullshit</i>. It’s just
  nature, and it’s nobody’s <i>fault,</i> but whose fault it is doesn’t matter.
  What matters is <i>survival,</i> and I’m sorry, but you’re not gonna survive
  if you rely on black people or gay people. Just look at Africa. Just look at
  the Roman Empire.”<br />
  <br />
  “No, no, no. I get that part, but I just... does it <i>have</i> to be all
  swastikas and Sieg heils and shit? I mean, no offense, but like, it seems like
  you’re going too far in the other direction. This isn’t Germany in the ‘30s.
  It feels like you’re all trying to dress up for Halloween or something,” said
  Seth, looking pointedly at the guy at the bar with a swastika tattoo on his
  neck.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus waved his hand dismissively. “What, the symbols and all that? It’s just
  ways for people to rebel, or support their favorite capes in the Empire. The
  symbolism is our way of saying <i>fuck the system. </i>It’s about reclaiming
  our heritage from all the lies and bullshit, and some people...” Marcus
  gestured at Spencer’s iron cross-decorated jacket before continuing, “...Just
  like that it drives the fuckers nuts.”<br />
  <br />
  “Okay, that’s fine, I guess, I’m not against free speech or whatever.” Seth
  said sulkily, taking a swig of his beer.<br />
  <br />
  Nodding equably, Marcus tried to steer things back on track. “Letting people
  just do their own thing is okay when things are good, but we’ve
  <i>tried</i> mashing people from different cultures together, and it just
  <i>doesn’t work</i>. We need to try something else.”<br />
  <br />
  “Man, come on. It’s not like the Nazis had the best track record either, they
  did some pretty fucked up shit too.” said Seth, chuckling dryly. “Like, even
  if all you said was true, killing all the Jews or whatever just doesn’t seem
  like it would <i>help</i> anything, just make things even worse.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus felt a flash of indignation at the jibe. It was genuinely disturbing to
  hear all the old fallacies and talking points trotted out robotically, almost
  verbatim. The sheep <i>always</i> brought it around to the Holocaust, every
  single time.<br />
  <br />
  “History is written by the victors, you know that. You’ve got to think for
  <i>yourself,”</i> Marcus said, the words coming out more snidely than he
  intended. He took a quick, calming breath, and continued in a more mellow
  tone, “Allied propaganda only gets a pass because they won in the end.
  Nowadays, people think of fascism like this one-sided, cartoonish thing, just
  bad guys for Indiana Jones and Uncle Sam to punch. When normal people think of
  Nazis, they think of black-and-white newsreels with Hitler speaking
  passionately in German—but haven’t you ever noticed they never include any
  subtitles? God forbid people hear a translation, or else they might end up
  <i>agreeing</i> with him.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth frowned. “I mean, I’ve never been that into history. I guess I never
  thought about getting the other side of the story,” he conceded.<br />
  <br />
  “Well, don’t just take <i>my</i> word for it,” Marcus said quickly, sensing an
  opportunity. “You should do your own research. You might be surprised by what
  you find. Bottom line, though, the world is in desperate need of
  <i>real</i> heroes and warriors who’ll fight for what’s right.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth sighed, sagging down in his chair, holding his drink between his knees.
  “I dunno, man. You’re right that the world’s fucked, but it feels like you’re
  just getting your hopes up.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned back and smiled. “Look around. You just see a couple of guys
  talking in a bar, right? But don’t underestimate that. The Nazi Party in
  Germany started out as a bunch of passionate guys in a beer hall in Munich,
  and only ten years later they united their country, then they created one of
  the greatest war machines to ever exist. The only reason Germany lost was
  because they were badly outnumbered. Now it it’s starting again, here, in the
  United States, the most powerful country in the world, and this time, we have
  parahumans that level the—”<br />
  <br />
  “There you are, ranting about history <i>again,”</i> Spencer interrupted as he
  walked up from behind Marcus, putting his hands on Marcus’s shoulders and
  shooting a smile at Seth. “I swear, when we’re not drinkin’ or kickin’ Chink
  ass, this nerd’s got his head stuck in some old history book. He’ll talk your
  ear off if you’re not careful.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tilted his head far back to see Spencer. “Did you lose already?”<br />
  <br />
  “Nah, just wanted a smoke break. Liza’ll tan my hide if I light up in here.
  Wanna come with?” Spencer asked, already rummaging for the pack in his jacket
  pockets.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus cocked his head, considering. Seth didn’t smoke, so he wouldn’t be
  joining them, but it would probably be best to let Seth stew on Marcus’s words
  for a bit anyway. “Eh, sure. I could go for one.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus got up and followed Spencer out the door. Rudy and Liza didn’t
  appreciate people smoking out front—both of them were health nuts that hated
  secondhand smoke—so they’d set up a semi-enclosed little stoop in the side
  alley for smokers, with an overhang to ward away the rain and a pair of
  standing ashtrays.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer lit up a cig, and offered Marcus one with the lighter.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus lit his own, and took a lazy drag. Spencer didn’t buy the best
  cigarettes, but at least he avoided the cheapest shit available.<br />
  <br />
  Taking another drag, Marcus tried his best to savor the rich smoke despite the
  chilly night air. He was just about to take another pull when he heard a loud
  <i>thump</i> from nearby, making him cough in surprise.<br />
  <br />
  There was a shuffling sound in the alley, down on the side with the dead end.
  Someone was there the whole time? Marcus peered into the darkness, but it was
  almost impossible to see beyond the cone of wan, yellow light cast by the
  single bulb installed in the overhang. Marcus saw the guy in the shadows
  first, and lightly slapped Spencer’s shoulder, pointing his friend towards the
  newcomer. It was a guy in a hoodie.<br />
  <br />
  "The fuck d’you want?" Spencer asked, a bit muffled from the cigarette he held
  in his lips.<br />
  <br />
  "Are you two Empire Eighty-Eight?” the hooded man asked tersely. He was
  fidgeting and trembling uncontrollably, which Marcus immediately pegged as
  drug withdrawal. As the man stepped closer to the light, Marcus could see he
  had that unmistakable hungry look to him, but he was also wearing Empire
  colors.<br />
  <br />
  That gave Marcus pause, but his confusion resolved as quickly as it had
  arisen. This dude was clearly one of the Merchant’s degenerates, probably
  trying to pick a fight or dress up as one of them and steal some drugs or
  something. The dumbass had picked the <i>worst</i> possible place to do it,
  though.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus and Spencer exchanged a skeptical look before refocusing on the
  junkie.<br />
  <br />
  "Yeah, we’re Empire—but just coming right up and asking, that’s a first," said
  Spencer, smiling humorlessly. "But this ain’t a fuckin’ charity. We don’t give
  freebies to losers on the street just ‘cause they’re white. Fuck off.”<br />
  <br />
  The hoodie guy said nothing, his gaze hawkish and intense. Marcus felt his
  stomach tense at the creepy look in the hooded man’s eyes. He moved closer,
  striding right towards them.<br />
  <br />
  Was this guy for <i>real?</i> He must have been jonesing <i>hard</i> to think
  taking on two-on-one odds was a good idea, even without the gun.<br />
  <br />
  “You asked for it, motherfucker,” Spencer snarled, reaching into his jacket
  and pulling out his huge Ruger Blackhawk revolver. The dark gray metal made it
  almost impossible to see in the dark, but the menacing shape of Spencer’s
  beloved .357 magnum would be unmistakable, even to a junkie.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus didn’t even have time to register what the hooded man was doing when
  his left hand slapped the gun out of Spencer’s grip before he could even cock
  the hammer. In nearly the same instant, the hooded man’s right hand seized
  Spencer by the neck, then he kicked Marcus in the gut with a visceral
  <i>crunch</i> that radiated through Marcus’s whole body. Pain exploded in his
  midsection as he was lifted off his feet by the force of the blow, his back
  slamming into the concrete ashtray and sending him spinning into the
  ground.<br />
  <br />
  After a moment of disorientation, with blinding stars dancing in Marcus’s
  vision, the pain truly hit in full, and he couldn’t even <i>breathe</i>. It
  felt like he’d been broken in <i>half</i>. His stomach and back radiated with
  pure, overwhelming agony, and he curled up on his side, his beers and
  hamburger coming back up, the bitter acid and alcohol burning his throat and
  sinuses.<br />
  <br />
  After the brief convulsion of vomiting ended, Marcus struggled to take the
  smallest of breaths. He blinked the stars out of his streaming eyes only to
  watch as the guy in the hoodie—<i>the unmasked cape, </i>he realized—lifted
  Spencer off his feet by the neck.<br />
  <br />
  The parahuman didn’t even flinch as Spencer flailed and struggled, punching
  his face and clawing at his icy blue eyes. Then, the parahuman’s arms
  <i>transformed</i> somehow, sprouting into a mass of dark, jagged cables that
  stabbed into Spencer’s body, dragging him into the monster whose entire upper
  body split apart into a flurry of countless lashing blades.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer was <i>shredded</i>.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer’s clothes were ripped away and his body burst open like an overfilled
  grocery bag, blood and viscera splattering out of his dismembered body in
  unbelievable quantities. A moment later, the entrails were drawn into the
  monster’s body like food getting sucked down into a blender. Marcus saw a
  pale, mauled section of Spencer’s torso briefly surface from the seething
  mass, the meat and skin stretching obscenely as it was torn away from the
  bloody ribs, and a moment later the dripping, red segment of ribcage was
  crushed back down into the mass of fanged tentacles.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus would have vomited again from sheer <i>terror</i> if he’d had the
  capacity to, but for the moment all he could do was try and fail to breathe.
  Where his vision wasn’t blurry from tears, there was blackness fading in
  around the edges, whether from lack of air or oncoming shock from his
  injury.<br />
  <br />
  There were no thoughts of calling for help or fighting back. Marcus only felt
  bone-deep agony and overwhelming, electrifying fear. The need to be somewhere,
  <i>anywhere</i> else paradoxically froze him in place, as if his body had
  overridden his brain and was trying to hide in plain sight or offer abject
  surrender. Spencer had just <i>died, </i>it was unbelievable, it didn’t make
  any <i>sense,</i> this place was supposed to be <i>safe</i>—but Marcus was
  certain that he was next.<br />
  <br />
  The monster was resolving into a humanoid shape again. The thing compressed
  itself, crunching down and ejecting spurts of blood and chunks of gore like a
  squeezed sponge as it shrank down to the size and shape of a human again.
  Marcus felt the hot wetness splatter over him, but didn’t dare blink or look
  away.<br />
  <br />
  In moments, the tentacled thing had molded back together like clay and changed
  color to become the hooded figure once more, clothes and all. It was
  spotlessly clean despite standing in a huge, spreading pool of blood and bits
  of Spencer that cascaded down the short steps and into the alley beyond.<br />
  <br />
  “Damn,” said the monster wearing human skin. “All that and I’m still
  hungry.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus could hardly believe his own ears. The thing sounded mildly
  disappointed, almost <i>bored,</i> like he’d gotten the wrong order at a
  drive-thru.<br />
  <br />
  He killed Spencer and <i>that</i> was all he had to say?<br />
  <br />
  That spark of rage was what finally broke Marcus free from the paralysis of
  terror.<br />
  <br />
  He couldn’t move much, but he saw where Spencer’s Ruger had clattered against
  the wall and fallen nearby. With a desperate adrenaline-fueled lunge that
  ignited the pain in his back, Marcus grabbed the gun and aimed—<br />
  <br />
  There was a blur of motion, a tight feeling in his arm and shoulder. His arm
  moved <i>wrongly,</i> the angles not matching.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus saw his right forearm falling in four pieces from the bloody stump of
  his elbow. Blood fountained from the stump, the warm wetness spreading over
  his shirt. It just felt numb.<br />
  <br />
  looking up, Marcus saw that the monster had transformed its fingers into long,
  thin, scythe-like claws that were almost hypnotic in the effortless,
  quicksilver way they moved, like the swaying of a cobra about to strike. He
  looked away from the claws, and met the thing’s pale, dead eyes. There was no
  anger, no regret, no humanity, just <i>hunger</i>. The thing didn’t even care
  at all that Marcus was a human being, he realized in an instant of
  understanding. It just saw Marcus as an acceptable target.<br />
  <br />
  Then the pain hit in earnest, a searing fire in Marcus’s shoulder and arm. He
  let out what little breath he’d had left in a shuddering moan as he clutched
  the stump close to his chest.<br />
  <br />
  No. No. No. <i>No</i>. This couldn’t be happening. Not here. He had to get
  away...<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tried to move, but he couldn’t. He was too weak. He hurt so, so much,
  he was so tired. All he wanted was to go to sleep, and not have to deal with
  this pain anymore. He wanted to go to sleep and wake up in bed back home, back
  with his family.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus squeezed his eyes shut, tears spilling out. He remembered all the
  stupid arguments he had with his family, how much they begged him to stay home
  and not join the Empire.<br />
  <br />
  <i>I’m sorry, Mom. I’m sorry, Cass.</i><br />
  <br />
  The last thing Marcus felt besides the pain and regret was the sensation of
  being lifted up off the ground.<br />
  <br />
  <b
    >A/N <br />
    Still with me after this chapter? Good. I was really nervous about this one,
    for obvious reasons. Humanizing Nazis and depicting their propaganda is
    always a perilous thing, although it is vitally important to the story to do
    so, for reasons that will become clear later. Needless to say, the opinions
    of the characters do not reflect the author’s, yadda yadda. Marcus is
    supposed to come off as a jumped-up know-nothing wehraboo and a hypocrite,
    but still just a scared, misguided teen underneath. I hope that came
    through.<br />
    <br />
    In other news, I have launched a new contest! It can be found under the
    Apocrypha thread. I can announce here that two prizes have been claimed thus
    far—congratulations again to TheLastOne, who won a bespoke chapter and
    requested a Regent interlude (timing TBD). I must also congratulate the new
    winner, InfiniteTangent, whose correct answer has won everyone a bonus
    chapter coming out this upcoming Tuesday. Thanks to everyone who

  <br />
  Marcus lounged in the Eagle’s Nest, slowly sinking into one of the bar’s
  comfortable leather couches. He was nursing his second tall glass of beer that
  night, mindful not to let the pleasant buzz muddle his thoughts. He wanted his
  mind to stay relatively sharp, but also keep the atmosphere relaxed. Marcus
  was admittedly a lightweight, in more ways than one, and it didn’t take much
  alcohol to get a good buzz going—unlike his best friend Spencer, who sat in a
  matching armchair to his left.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer charitably described himself as ‘husky,’ in stark contrast to Marcus,
  and as a result Spencer could pound away drinks all night long and barely show
  it. He was currently demolishing a fourth beer. That was fine, since he wasn’t
  here to do the talking anyway. Spencer was around more to provide Marcus moral
  support and, admittedly, to complement him with a more normal and less serious
  side of things. It had been Spencer’s idea to invite the third member of their
  little group.<br />
  <br />
  On Marcus’s right sat Seth, the younger brother of an old high school friend
  of Spencer’s. Seth might have been okay with drinking alongside Spencer and
  Marcus—at least partly because he couldn’t get easy access to booze anywhere
  else—but he wasn’t a member of the Empire Eighty-Eight like Spencer and Marcus
  were. Marcus hoped to change that tonight. He had been noticed for his budding
  talent at changing minds, having brought two other members into the Empire in
  just six months, and adding a third would help him move up in the
  organization.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tended to prefer the deep and serious approach to recruitment, but
  Spencer was good at just making friends. He often reminded Marcus of a dog, in
  both good and bad ways. Spencer was friendly, silly, and a bit too fond of
  food, but he was brave and loyal when it counted the most. Marcus couldn’t
  have asked for a better friend, or a better partner in crime to try winning
  over hearts and minds. Spencer could handle the heart, while Marcus would
  target the mind.<br />
  <br />
  Seth had started out nervous when he’d entered the bar, but with the help of
  Spencer’s happy-go-lucky teasing and antics, he’d mellowed out considerably.
  That was good—it would make the next part easier.<br />
  <br />
  “What’s with the dopey smile?” Spencer asked Marcus.<br />
  <br />
  “Just thinkin’ about days gone by. You know. High school. How glad I am to put
  that shit behind me,” said Marcus, smirking at Seth before taking another sip
  of beer.<br />
  <br />
  “Yeah, man. Ancient history,” Seth responded with heavy irony, conveniently
  ignoring that he was 17 and still a senior at Winslow High.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer snorted. “Oh, fuck off with your <i>ancient history</i>. If it weren’t
  for us vouching for you, Liza would have tossed you out on your ass for
  showing up with that two-bit fake I.D.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth gestured at Marcus. “He’s only one grade ahead of me, why aren’t you
  getting on <i>his</i> case?”<br />
  <br />
  “It’s not about drinking age, it’s about who you <i>know</i>. Marcus and I are
  members of the club. You’re just our guest,” Spencer said sagely.<br />
  <br />
  “Come on, Spence,” Marcus gently chided. “He’s just here to relax and have a
  good time. This isn’t a members-only bar.”<br />
  <br />
  Spencer scoffed. “Like hell it isn’t! Look around, do you see
  <i>anyone</i> who’s not white?”<br />
  <br />
  “It’s more than just that. If all they did was keep out Merchants and homeless
  trash, that would be kind of a low bar,” Marcus pointed out.<br />
  <br />
  “Pun intended, right? You get weird when you drink, I ever tell you that? All
  serious and philly-<i>philosophical</i>. It’s fuckin’... nerdy as shit.”
  Spencer said, stumbling a bit over his words.<br />
  <br />
  “Whereas <i>you</i> get all tongue-tied,” Marcus deadpanned.<br />
  <br />
  “I’ll have you know I’m fluent in sign language too, jackass.” said Spencer,
  flipping Marcus the bird and then launching into an elaborate pantomime with a
  lot of pointing and unintelligible arm-chopping motions.<br />
  <br />
  “The hell are you even doing?” Seth laughed.<br />
  <br />
  “Lettin’ Marcus know he’s a sad little stick-in-the-mud.” said Spencer,
  stopping his wild gestures.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shrugged. Spencer’s teasing had long since stopped making him feel
  offended, not when he knew Spencer wasn’t really serious and tried to insult
  just about everyone he thought he could get away with.<br />
  <br />
  “Come on, you fuckin’ <i>lump</i>. Don’t you at least wanna play pool or
  something?” Spencer wheedled. He could be surprisingly shrewish for a guy with
  a beer belly and deep baritone voice.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus rolled his eyes. “Even <i>sober</i> you couldn’t hit the broad side of
  a barn, much less a billiard ball. Maybe try your luck with Landon over there,
  he looks like he can barely stand. If you can beat him, get back to me.”<br />
  <br />
  Spencer stood up and walked off, muttering. “I dunno why I hang around with
  such a stuck-up little toothpick.”<br />
  <br />
  Chuckling at his friend, Marcus settled back, relaxing. He let the sounds of
  the room wash over him, the charging beat of the rock music playing at medium
  volume in the background, the murmur of the crowd, the clink of glasses and
  silverware. He loved relaxing at the Eagle’s Nest. It was a safe haven full of
  simple pleasures, a stress-free environment compared to the howling goddamn
  insanity that was Brockton Bay.<br />
  <br />
  Seth, however, was fidgeting and seemed quite restless. His fear at being
  busted for underage drinking had evaporated, but he still looked like he
  didn’t quite know what to do with himself in this place where he stuck out
  like a sore thumb. He was the only one in the whole bar with shoulder-length
  brown hair, everyone else was either a natural or dyed blonde like Marcus, or
  a skinhead like Spencer.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus waited patiently. The topic of the Empire’s ideology was going to come
  up eventually. People didn’t listen when you tried to shove your worldview
  down their throats, they just got defensive and shut down, he knew that much
  from bitter experience with his mom and sister. If you just left the door open
  and answered their questions, though, they’d be a lot more receptive to what
  you had to say.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus’s gaze fell on the elaborately wrought iron eagle mounted in the corner
  near the ceiling, holding the corners of two flags in its claws. One was the
  Imperial German war ensign, the other an Iron Cross on a black background. It
  made Marcus feel a warm flush of pride.<br />
  <br />
  “Hey, Marcus. What are you thinking about?” Seth finally asked.<br />
  <br />
  “Just appreciating the vexillolography,” Marcus said, nodding at the flag.<br />
  <br />
  “Gesundheit,” said Seth, raising an eyebrow.<br />
  <br />
  “It means the art of the flags. There’s a lot of meaning behind every element
  in the colors and symbols.” Marcus said.<br />
  <br />
  “I’ve been meaning to ask you about that—not the flag, I mean, but all the
  Nazi stuff. Like, I know the Nazis had some cool shit and all, but I don’t get
  why you and your, uh, <i>friends</i> are all gung-ho about them. You’re not
  even German.” Seth pointed out.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus chuckled, leaning forward. “You know, I’m <i>so</i> glad you asked
  about the <i>good news...!”</i> he said with mock brightness, doing his best
  door-knocking evangelist impression.<br />
  <br />
  “Oh, God, spare me the sales pitch. Forget I said anything!” said Seth,
  covering his eyes.<br />
  <br />
  They both laughed together, in that un-self-conscious way that only partially
  inebriated people could manage.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned back, sighing after the laughing fit passed. “Seriously, though,
  dude. I won’t push, but do you really want to know?”<br />
  <br />
  Seth shrugged. “I mean, kinda? I’ve always been more interested in the biker
  and metalhead scenes, but if you hang out around those long enough, you pick
  up a thing or two. I don’t really get it, though. I mean, don’t get me wrong,
  I hate those ABB motherfuckers, but I don’t get the jump from that to, like,
  full-on Nazis.”<br />
  <br />
  “I think you understand more than you think,” Marcus said, holding up a hand.
  “Maybe it’ll help to give you an example. For me, I started coming around when
  I began noticing that something was really wrong with the world.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth scoffed. “There’s a <i>lot</i> wrong with the world. There’s wars and
  Endbringers and the Water Crisis and all that shit.”<br />
  <br />
  “I mean besides the obvious. There’s something rotten with
  <i>normal</i> people, the way they think and act. You know, just culture in
  general,” Marcus pressed, waving a finger in a circle as if to encompass the
  whole world. “Didn’t everything seem so much more hopeful when we were kids? I
  mean, we were both born after the Golden Age of Superheroes ended, but things
  weren’t so bad on the surface. Behemoth came around before I could really
  remember, but people didn’t really know what that had <i>meant</i> yet. Do you
  remember when Jörmungandr first appeared?”<br />
  <br />
  “Who?” asked Seth, his brow knitting in confusion.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned in closer, quietly listing off the names of the beast.
  “Jörmungandr. The Second. The Serpent. <i>Leviathan</i>.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus saw a spark of interest in Seth’s eyes, and knew he’d hit pay dirt, a
  true connection. The truth that can only be uncovered by shared experience.<br />
  <br />
  “I do,” Seth said, his voice coming out hushed, subconsciously mirroring
  Marcus’ own serious tone. “What’s that got to do with Nazis, though?”<br />
  <br />
  <i>“Everything,”</i> Marcus said, spreading his arms wide. “It’s all
  connected. I’ll tell you the story, if you like.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth still looked a little skeptical, but he’d picked up on Marcus’s serious
  mood. He nodded solemnly.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus mentally girded himself, disciplining his thoughts into order. It was
  hard being a recruiter. He had to bare his soul and confront some heavy shit,
  the dark truths that everyone knew but preferred to ignore. And he had to do
  all that with total conviction and confidence, without flinching away from the
  uncomfortable parts. It opened Marcus up to mockery or attacks or joking
  deflections, but it was necessary. People could sense insincerity a mile away.
  He had to make himself vulnerable to be believed, then build that connection
  up into something strong.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus took a deep breath, and began his story.<br />
  <br />
  “One of my earliest memories was watching TV with my big sister, some cartoon
  or something. Suddenly, the movie cut out, and it started showing the news, so
  my sister tried changing the channel, but it was all the same thing on
  <i>every</i> channel, talking about Jörmungandr appearing for the first time.
  I was just a little kid, I didn’t know what was going on, and Cass wouldn’t
  tell me, so I called out to Mom. She came into the living room, and then she
  just <i>froze</i>. I don’t really remember what the news was saying, but I’ll
  never forget the look on her face. How she went all still and white. Seeing my
  mom, standing there like a statue, just... I could tell she was rooted by pure
  <i>fear, </i>and it scared me more than anything I’d ever seen in my life.
  Then she grabbed both of us, hugging us so hard it <i>hurt,</i> and even
  though she couldn’t stop <i>crying,</i> she still didn’t look away from the
  TV, not even once. We didn’t understand what happened, but it was mom’s
  reaction that made it <i>real</i>. After that, I saw the despair everywhere,
  but I didn’t understand it, what that really <i>meant</i> for the world, not
  until years later.”<br />
  <br />
  As Marcus spoke, he felt chills racing down his body, goosebumps rippling out
  over his arms at reliving the memory.<br />
  <br />
  “Are you talking about Leviathan being the reason for the boat graveyard, and
  the city’s economy getting fucked up?” Seth asked as Marcus took a drink to
  soothe his suddenly dry throat.<br />
  <br />
  “That’s only a tiny part of it. <i>Everything</i> went downhill from there,
  <i>everywhere</i>. You and I, our generation, we could feel it even when we
  were kids, and growing up it only got worse. Think about it—when Jörmungandr
  sank Kyushu, that’s when all the immigrants started flooding in. Not just in
  Brockton Bay with the ABB turning the place into a shithole, there’s
  <i>millions</i> of refugees all over, and it’s only going to get a thousand
  times worse in a few years. So what’s <i>wrong</i> with people? They’re all
  <i>terrified, </i>but they’re pretending that they aren’t. People are too busy
  with sports or celebrities or drugs or whatever pointless, petty bullshit they
  use to distract themselves from thinking.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth nodded. “Oh yeah. It’s all total bullshit, we can agree on that part.
  People would rather have their comfortable lies instead of the hard truth. I
  don’t sign on to all the race stuff, though.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus felt his cheeks flush a little with his frustration, and hoped it
  didn’t show. The pitch had started well, but now it felt like he was losing
  Seth, so he decided to go for one of his trump cards. “About the race stuff, I
  get it. I do. We’ve been taught from birth it’s bad. Kumbaya and give peace a
  chance and all that shit the mass media pushes to keep everyone in line. But
  you can just as easily say <i>fighting</i> is bad. There’s no room for that
  out in the <i>real</i> world, where things like fighting and racism are
  sometimes <i>necessary</i>. I’ve heard it explained this way, and it really
  stuck with me: think of the world like a sinking ship. Your country—as in,
  your culture, that’s the lifeboat.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth raised a skeptical eyebrow. “So you’re saying we’re like the
  <i>Titanic</i>, and the Jews are like the iceberg or something?”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shook his head, resisting the urge to call out Seth’s stupidity. “No,
  not at all. What I mean is, the ship’s like the world, and it’s already
  sinking, there’s nothing we can do to stop it now. Think of white culture as
  the last lifeboat. Everyone knows it’s their best chance, so everyone’s
  flocking to it. But if too many people try to climb on the lifeboat, they’ll
  sink the whole thing for everyone. Sure, you can give up your spot on the boat
  if you want to be <i>nice</i> or whatever, but then you’re just, y’know,
  adding to the problem, because the guy you let on wants to bring
  <i>his</i> family, <i>his</i> friends, and now suddenly everyone’s fighting
  each other instead of defending the boat. The lifeboat sinks, everyone dies,
  and <i>nobody</i> is better off just because you did the ‘nice’ thing. In
  order to survive, we have to <i>fight,</i> and to fight we have to be united
  by something stronger. A shared culture, shared blood. I know no one
  <i>else</i> is going to fight for me, all the other races only ever stick up
  for themselves. So why shouldn’t we?”<br />
  <br />
  Seth shrugged helplessly. “Look, I’m all for protecting my own culture. I
  don’t have any problem with that, and I’m proud to be white too. It’s a good
  thing, right? I don’t know what else to tell you, though. All the Asians can
  fuck right off back to where they came from, but I don’t see the point of
  being so hung up over the blacks and gays and Jews. It just seems... kinda
  pointless, you know?”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shook his head. “I’m sorry if it’s hard to accept, but including blacks
  and gays and whatever else is a luxury we just can’t <i>afford</i>. Black
  people and their problems are a liability in this fight, you don’t have to
  hate them, but that’s just a <i>fact</i>. They’re less than 13% of the
  population, but they commit the majority of the crimes. White people have an
  IQ of 100 and black people have an IQ of 80. That’s just the truth, and it
  won’t change for anybody’s politically correct <i>bullshit</i>. It’s just
  nature, and it’s nobody’s <i>fault,</i> but whose fault it is doesn’t matter.
  What matters is <i>survival,</i> and I’m sorry, but you’re not gonna survive
  if you rely on black people or gay people. Just look at Africa. Just look at
  the Roman Empire.”<br />
  <br />
  “No, no, no. I get that part, but I just... does it <i>have</i> to be all
  swastikas and Sieg heils and shit? I mean, no offense, but like, it seems like
  you’re going too far in the other direction. This isn’t Germany in the ‘30s.
  It feels like you’re all trying to dress up for Halloween or something,” said
  Seth, looking pointedly at the guy at the bar with a swastika tattoo on his
  neck.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus waved his hand dismissively. “What, the symbols and all that? It’s just
  ways for people to rebel, or support their favorite capes in the Empire. The
  symbolism is our way of saying <i>fuck the system. </i>It’s about reclaiming
  our heritage from all the lies and bullshit, and some people...” Marcus
  gestured at Spencer’s iron cross-decorated jacket before continuing, “...Just
  like that it drives the fuckers nuts.”<br />
  <br />
  “Okay, that’s fine, I guess, I’m not against free speech or whatever.” Seth
  said sulkily, taking a swig of his beer.<br />
  <br />
  Nodding equably, Marcus tried to steer things back on track. “Letting people
  just do their own thing is okay when things are good, but we’ve
  <i>tried</i> mashing people from different cultures together, and it just
  <i>doesn’t work</i>. We need to try something else.”<br />
  <br />
  “Man, come on. It’s not like the Nazis had the best track record either, they
  did some pretty fucked up shit too.” said Seth, chuckling dryly. “Like, even
  if all you said was true, killing all the Jews or whatever just doesn’t seem
  like it would <i>help</i> anything, just make things even worse.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus felt a flash of indignation at the jibe. It was genuinely disturbing to
  hear all the old fallacies and talking points trotted out robotically, almost
  verbatim. The sheep <i>always</i> brought it around to the Holocaust, every
  single time.<br />
  <br />
  “History is written by the victors, you know that. You’ve got to think for
  <i>yourself,”</i> Marcus said, the words coming out more snidely than he
  intended. He took a quick, calming breath, and continued in a more mellow
  tone, “Allied propaganda only gets a pass because they won in the end.
  Nowadays, people think of fascism like this one-sided, cartoonish thing, just
  bad guys for Indiana Jones and Uncle Sam to punch. When normal people think of
  Nazis, they think of black-and-white newsreels with Hitler speaking
  passionately in German—but haven’t you ever noticed they never include any
  subtitles? God forbid people hear a translation, or else they might end up
  <i>agreeing</i> with him.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth frowned. “I mean, I’ve never been that into history. I guess I never
  thought about getting the other side of the story,” he conceded.<br />
  <br />
  “Well, don’t just take <i>my</i> word for it,” Marcus said quickly, sensing an
  opportunity. “You should do your own research. You might be surprised by what
  you find. Bottom line, though, the world is in desperate need of
  <i>real</i> heroes and warriors who’ll fight for what’s right.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth sighed, sagging down in his chair, holding his drink between his knees.
  “I dunno, man. You’re right that the world’s fucked, but it feels like you’re
  just getting your hopes up.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned back and smiled. “Look around. You just see a couple of guys
  talking in a bar, right? But don’t underestimate that. The Nazi Party in
  Germany started out as a bunch of passionate guys in a beer hall in Munich,
  and only ten years later they united their country, then they created one of
  the greatest war machines to ever exist. The only reason Germany lost was
  because they were badly outnumbered. Now it it’s starting again, here, in the
  United States, the most powerful country in the world, and this time, we have
  parahumans that level the—”<br />
  <br />
  “There you are, ranting about history <i>again,”</i> Spencer interrupted as he
  walked up from behind Marcus, putting his hands on Marcus’s shoulders and
  shooting a smile at Seth. “I swear, when we’re not drinkin’ or kickin’ Chink
  ass, this nerd’s got his head stuck in some old history book. He’ll talk your
  ear off if you’re not careful.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tilted his head far back to see Spencer. “Did you lose already?”<br />
  <br />
  “Nah, just wanted a smoke break. Liza’ll tan my hide if I light up in here.
  Wanna come with?” Spencer asked, already rummaging for the pack in his jacket
  pockets.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus cocked his head, considering. Seth didn’t smoke, so he wouldn’t be
  joining them, but it would probably be best to let Seth stew on Marcus’s words
  for a bit anyway. “Eh, sure. I could go for one.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus got up and followed Spencer out the door. Rudy and Liza didn’t
  appreciate people smoking out front—both of them were health nuts that hated
  secondhand smoke—so they’d set up a semi-enclosed little stoop in the side
  alley for smokers, with an overhang to ward away the rain and a pair of
  standing ashtrays.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer lit up a cig, and offered Marcus one with the lighter.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus lit his own, and took a lazy drag. Spencer didn’t buy the best
  cigarettes, but at least he avoided the cheapest shit available.<br />
  <br />
  Taking another drag, Marcus tried his best to savor the rich smoke despite the
  chilly night air. He was just about to take another pull when he heard a loud
  <i>thump</i> from nearby, making him cough in surprise.<br />
  <br />
  There was a shuffling sound in the alley, down on the side with the dead end.
  Someone was there the whole time? Marcus peered into the darkness, but it was
  almost impossible to see beyond the cone of wan, yellow light cast by the
  single bulb installed in the overhang. Marcus saw the guy in the shadows
  first, and lightly slapped Spencer’s shoulder, pointing his friend towards the
  newcomer. It was a guy in a hoodie.<br />
  <br />
  "The fuck d’you want?" Spencer asked, a bit muffled from the cigarette he held
  in his lips.<br />
  <br />
  "Are you two Empire Eighty-Eight?” the hooded man asked tersely. He was
  fidgeting and trembling uncontrollably, which Marcus immediately pegged as
  drug withdrawal. As the man stepped closer to the light, Marcus could see he
  had that unmistakable hungry look to him, but he was also wearing Empire
  colors.<br />
  <br />
  That gave Marcus pause, but his confusion resolved as quickly as it had
  arisen. This dude was clearly one of the Merchant’s degenerates, probably
  trying to pick a fight or dress up as one of them and steal some drugs or
  something. The dumbass had picked the <i>worst</i> possible place to do it,
  though.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus and Spencer exchanged a skeptical look before refocusing on the
  junkie.<br />
  <br />
  "Yeah, we’re Empire—but just coming right up and asking, that’s a first," said
  Spencer, smiling humorlessly. "But this ain’t a fuckin’ charity. We don’t give
  freebies to losers on the street just ‘cause they’re white. Fuck off.”<br />
  <br />
  The hoodie guy said nothing, his gaze hawkish and intense. Marcus felt his
  stomach tense at the creepy look in the hooded man’s eyes. He moved closer,
  striding right towards them.<br />
  <br />
  Was this guy for <i>real?</i> He must have been jonesing <i>hard</i> to think
  taking on two-on-one odds was a good idea, even without the gun.<br />
  <br />
  “You asked for it, motherfucker,” Spencer snarled, reaching into his jacket
  and pulling out his huge Ruger Blackhawk revolver. The dark gray metal made it
  almost impossible to see in the dark, but the menacing shape of Spencer’s
  beloved .357 magnum would be unmistakable, even to a junkie.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus didn’t even have time to register what the hooded man was doing when
  his left hand slapped the gun out of Spencer’s grip before he could even cock
  the hammer. In nearly the same instant, the hooded man’s right hand seized
  Spencer by the neck, then he kicked Marcus in the gut with a visceral
  <i>crunch</i> that radiated through Marcus’s whole body. Pain exploded in his
  midsection as he was lifted off his feet by the force of the blow, his back
  slamming into the concrete ashtray and sending him spinning into the
  ground.<br />
  <br />
  After a moment of disorientation, with blinding stars dancing in Marcus’s
  vision, the pain truly hit in full, and he couldn’t even <i>breathe</i>. It
  felt like he’d been broken in <i>half</i>. His stomach and back radiated with
  pure, overwhelming agony, and he curled up on his side, his beers and
  hamburger coming back up, the bitter acid and alcohol burning his throat and
  sinuses.<br />
  <br />
  After the brief convulsion of vomiting ended, Marcus struggled to take the
  smallest of breaths. He blinked the stars out of his streaming eyes only to
  watch as the guy in the hoodie—<i>the unmasked cape, </i>he realized—lifted
  Spencer off his feet by the neck.<br />
  <br />
  The parahuman didn’t even flinch as Spencer flailed and struggled, punching
  his face and clawing at his icy blue eyes. Then, the parahuman’s arms
  <i>transformed</i> somehow, sprouting into a mass of dark, jagged cables that
  stabbed into Spencer’s body, dragging him into the monster whose entire upper
  body split apart into a flurry of countless lashing blades.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer was <i>shredded</i>.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer’s clothes were ripped away and his body burst open like an overfilled
  grocery bag, blood and viscera splattering out of his dismembered body in
  unbelievable quantities. A moment later, the entrails were drawn into the
  monster’s body like food getting sucked down into a blender. Marcus saw a
  pale, mauled section of Spencer’s torso briefly surface from the seething
  mass, the meat and skin stretching obscenely as it was torn away from the
  bloody ribs, and a moment later the dripping, red segment of ribcage was
  crushed back down into the mass of fanged tentacles.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus would have vomited again from sheer <i>terror</i> if he’d had the
  capacity to, but for the moment all he could do was try and fail to breathe.
  Where his vision wasn’t blurry from tears, there was blackness fading in
  around the edges, whether from lack of air or oncoming shock from his
  injury.<br />
  <br />
  There were no thoughts of calling for help or fighting back. Marcus only felt
  bone-deep agony and overwhelming, electrifying fear. The need to be somewhere,
  <i>anywhere</i> else paradoxically froze him in place, as if his body had
  overridden his brain and was trying to hide in plain sight or offer abject
  surrender. Spencer had just <i>died, </i>it was unbelievable, it didn’t make
  any <i>sense,</i> this place was supposed to be <i>safe</i>—but Marcus was
  certain that he was next.<br />
  <br />
  The monster was resolving into a humanoid shape again. The thing compressed
  itself, crunching down and ejecting spurts of blood and chunks of gore like a
  squeezed sponge as it shrank down to the size and shape of a human again.
  Marcus felt the hot wetness splatter over him, but didn’t dare blink or look
  away.<br />
  <br />
  In moments, the tentacled thing had molded back together like clay and changed
  color to become the hooded figure once more, clothes and all. It was
  spotlessly clean despite standing in a huge, spreading pool of blood and bits
  of Spencer that cascaded down the short steps and into the alley beyond.<br />
  <br />
  “Damn,” said the monster wearing human skin. “All that and I’m still
  hungry.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus could hardly believe his own ears. The thing sounded mildly
  disappointed, almost <i>bored,</i> like he’d gotten the wrong order at a
  drive-thru.<br />
  <br />
  He killed Spencer and <i>that</i> was all he had to say?<br />
  <br />
  That spark of rage was what finally broke Marcus free from the paralysis of
  terror.<br />
  <br />
  He couldn’t move much, but he saw where Spencer’s Ruger had clattered against
  the wall and fallen nearby. With a desperate adrenaline-fueled lunge that
  ignited the pain in his back, Marcus grabbed the gun and aimed—<br />
  <br />
  There was a blur of motion, a tight feeling in his arm and shoulder. His arm
  moved <i>wrongly,</i> the angles not matching.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus saw his right forearm falling in four pieces from the bloody stump of
  his elbow. Blood fountained from the stump, the warm wetness spreading over
  his shirt. It just felt numb.<br />
  <br />
  looking up, Marcus saw that the monster had transformed its fingers into long,
  thin, scythe-like claws that were almost hypnotic in the effortless,
  quicksilver way they moved, like the swaying of a cobra about to strike. He
  looked away from the claws, and met the thing’s pale, dead eyes. There was no
  anger, no regret, no humanity, just <i>hunger</i>. The thing didn’t even care
  at all that Marcus was a human being, he realized in an instant of
  understanding. It just saw Marcus as an acceptable target.<br />
  <br />
  Then the pain hit in earnest, a searing fire in Marcus’s shoulder and arm. He
  let out what little breath he’d had left in a shuddering moan as he clutched
  the stump close to his chest.<br />
  <br />
  No. No. No. <i>No</i>. This couldn’t be happening. Not here. He had to get
  away...<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tried to move, but he couldn’t. He was too weak. He hurt so, so much,
  he was so tired. All he wanted was to go to sleep, and not have to deal with
  this pain anymore. He wanted to go to sleep and wake up in bed back home, back
  with his family.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus squeezed his eyes shut, tears spilling out. He remembered all the
  stupid arguments he had with his family, how much they begged him to stay home
  and not join the Empire.<br />
  <br />
  <i>I’m sorry, Mom. I’m sorry, Cass.</i><br />
  <br />
  The last thing Marcus felt besides the pain and regret was the sensation of
  being lifted up off the ground.<br />
  <br />
  <b
    >A/N <br />
    Still with me after this chapter? Good. I was really nervous about this one,
    for obvious reasons. Humanizing Nazis and depicting their propaganda is
    always a perilous thing, although it is vitally important to the story to do
    so, for reasons that will become clear later. Needless to say, the opinions
    of the characters do not reflect the author’s, yadda yadda. Marcus is

<div class="bbWrapper">
  <b>Infection 2.M</b><br />
  <br />
  Marcus lounged in the Eagle’s Nest, slowly sinking into one of the bar’s
  comfortable leather couches. He was nursing his second tall glass of beer that
  night, mindful not to let the pleasant buzz muddle his thoughts. He wanted his
  mind to stay relatively sharp, but also keep the atmosphere relaxed. Marcus
  was admittedly a lightweight, in more ways than one, and it didn’t take much
  alcohol to get a good buzz going—unlike his best friend Spencer, who sat in a
  matching armchair to his left.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer charitably described himself as ‘husky,’ in stark contrast to Marcus,
  and as a result Spencer could pound away drinks all night long and barely show
  it. He was currently demolishing a fourth beer. That was fine, since he wasn’t
  here to do the talking anyway. Spencer was around more to provide Marcus moral
  support and, admittedly, to complement him with a more normal and less serious
  side of things. It had been Spencer’s idea to invite the third member of their
  little group.<br />
  <br />
  On Marcus’s right sat Seth, the younger brother of an old high school friend
  of Spencer’s. Seth might have been okay with drinking alongside Spencer and
  Marcus—at least partly because he couldn’t get easy access to booze anywhere
  else—but he wasn’t a member of the Empire Eighty-Eight like Spencer and Marcus
  were. Marcus hoped to change that tonight. He had been noticed for his budding
  talent at changing minds, having brought two other members into the Empire in
  just six months, and adding a third would help him move up in the
  organization.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tended to prefer the deep and serious approach to recruitment, but
  Spencer was good at just making friends. He often reminded Marcus of a dog, in
  both good and bad ways. Spencer was friendly, silly, and a bit too fond of
  food, but he was brave and loyal when it counted the most. Marcus couldn’t
  have asked for a better friend, or a better partner in crime to try winning
  over hearts and minds. Spencer could handle the heart, while Marcus would
  target the mind.<br />
  <br />
  Seth had started out nervous when he’d entered the bar, but with the help of
  Spencer’s happy-go-lucky teasing and antics, he’d mellowed out considerably.
  That was good—it would make the next part easier.<br />
  <br />
  “What’s with the dopey smile?” Spencer asked Marcus.<br />
  <br />
  “Just thinkin’ about days gone by. You know. High school. How glad I am to put
  that shit behind me,” said Marcus, smirking at Seth before taking another sip
  of beer.<br />
  <br />
  “Yeah, man. Ancient history,” Seth responded with heavy irony, conveniently
  ignoring that he was 17 and still a senior at Winslow High.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer snorted. “Oh, fuck off with your <i>ancient history</i>. If it weren’t
  for us vouching for you, Liza would have tossed you out on your ass for
  showing up with that two-bit fake I.D.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth gestured at Marcus. “He’s only one grade ahead of me, why aren’t you
  getting on <i>his</i> case?”<br />
  <br />
  “It’s not about drinking age, it’s about who you <i>know</i>. Marcus and I are
  members of the club. You’re just our guest,” Spencer said sagely.<br />
  <br />
  “Come on, Spence,” Marcus gently chided. “He’s just here to relax and have a
  good time. This isn’t a members-only bar.”<br />
  <br />
  Spencer scoffed. “Like hell it isn’t! Look around, do you see
  <i>anyone</i> who’s not white?”<br />
  <br />
  “It’s more than just that. If all they did was keep out Merchants and homeless
  trash, that would be kind of a low bar,” Marcus pointed out.<br />
  <br />
  “Pun intended, right? You get weird when you drink, I ever tell you that? All
  serious and philly-<i>philosophical</i>. It’s fuckin’... nerdy as shit.”
  Spencer said, stumbling a bit over his words.<br />
  <br />
  “Whereas <i>you</i> get all tongue-tied,” Marcus deadpanned.<br />
  <br />
  “I’ll have you know I’m fluent in sign language too, jackass.” said Spencer,
  flipping Marcus the bird and then launching into an elaborate pantomime with a
  lot of pointing and unintelligible arm-chopping motions.<br />
  <br />
  “The hell are you even doing?” Seth laughed.<br />
  <br />
  “Lettin’ Marcus know he’s a sad little stick-in-the-mud.” said Spencer,
  stopping his wild gestures.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shrugged. Spencer’s teasing had long since stopped making him feel
  offended, not when he knew Spencer wasn’t really serious and tried to insult
  just about everyone he thought he could get away with.<br />
  <br />
  “Come on, you fuckin’ <i>lump</i>. Don’t you at least wanna play pool or
  something?” Spencer wheedled. He could be surprisingly shrewish for a guy with
  a beer belly and deep baritone voice.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus rolled his eyes. “Even <i>sober</i> you couldn’t hit the broad side of
  a barn, much less a billiard ball. Maybe try your luck with Landon over there,
  he looks like he can barely stand. If you can beat him, get back to me.”<br />
  <br />
  Spencer stood up and walked off, muttering. “I dunno why I hang around with
  such a stuck-up little toothpick.”<br />
  <br />
  Chuckling at his friend, Marcus settled back, relaxing. He let the sounds of
  the room wash over him, the charging beat of the rock music playing at medium
  volume in the background, the murmur of the crowd, the clink of glasses and
  silverware. He loved relaxing at the Eagle’s Nest. It was a safe haven full of
  simple pleasures, a stress-free environment compared to the howling goddamn
  insanity that was Brockton Bay.<br />
  <br />
  Seth, however, was fidgeting and seemed quite restless. His fear at being
  busted for underage drinking had evaporated, but he still looked like he
  didn’t quite know what to do with himself in this place where he stuck out
  like a sore thumb. He was the only one in the whole bar with shoulder-length
  brown hair, everyone else was either a natural or dyed blonde like Marcus, or
  a skinhead like Spencer.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus waited patiently. The topic of the Empire’s ideology was going to come
  up eventually. People didn’t listen when you tried to shove your worldview
  down their throats, they just got defensive and shut down, he knew that much
  from bitter experience with his mom and sister. If you just left the door open
  and answered their questions, though, they’d be a lot more receptive to what
  you had to say.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus’s gaze fell on the elaborately wrought iron eagle mounted in the corner
  near the ceiling, holding the corners of two flags in its claws. One was the
  Imperial German war ensign, the other an Iron Cross on a black background. It
  made Marcus feel a warm flush of pride.<br />
  <br />
  “Hey, Marcus. What are you thinking about?” Seth finally asked.<br />
  <br />
  “Just appreciating the vexillolography,” Marcus said, nodding at the flag.<br />
  <br />
  “Gesundheit,” said Seth, raising an eyebrow.<br />
  <br />
  “It means the art of the flags. There’s a lot of meaning behind every element
  in the colors and symbols.” Marcus said.<br />
  <br />
  “I’ve been meaning to ask you about that—not the flag, I mean, but all the
  Nazi stuff. Like, I know the Nazis had some cool shit and all, but I don’t get
  why you and your, uh, <i>friends</i> are all gung-ho about them. You’re not
  even German.” Seth pointed out.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus chuckled, leaning forward. “You know, I’m <i>so</i> glad you asked
  about the <i>good news...!”</i> he said with mock brightness, doing his best
  door-knocking evangelist impression.<br />
  <br />
  “Oh, God, spare me the sales pitch. Forget I said anything!” said Seth,
  covering his eyes.<br />
  <br />
  They both laughed together, in that un-self-conscious way that only partially
  inebriated people could manage.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned back, sighing after the laughing fit passed. “Seriously, though,
  dude. I won’t push, but do you really want to know?”<br />
  <br />
  Seth shrugged. “I mean, kinda? I’ve always been more interested in the biker
  and metalhead scenes, but if you hang out around those long enough, you pick
  up a thing or two. I don’t really get it, though. I mean, don’t get me wrong,
  I hate those ABB motherfuckers, but I don’t get the jump from that to, like,
  full-on Nazis.”<br />
  <br />
  “I think you understand more than you think,” Marcus said, holding up a hand.
  “Maybe it’ll help to give you an example. For me, I started coming around when
  I began noticing that something was really wrong with the world.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth scoffed. “There’s a <i>lot</i> wrong with the world. There’s wars and
  Endbringers and the Water Crisis and all that shit.”<br />
  <br />
  “I mean besides the obvious. There’s something rotten with
  <i>normal</i> people, the way they think and act. You know, just culture in
  general,” Marcus pressed, waving a finger in a circle as if to encompass the
  whole world. “Didn’t everything seem so much more hopeful when we were kids? I
  mean, we were both born after the Golden Age of Superheroes ended, but things
  weren’t so bad on the surface. Behemoth came around before I could really
  remember, but people didn’t really know what that had <i>meant</i> yet. Do you
  remember when Jörmungandr first appeared?”<br />
  <br />
  “Who?” asked Seth, his brow knitting in confusion.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned in closer, quietly listing off the names of the beast.
  “Jörmungandr. The Second. The Serpent. <i>Leviathan</i>.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus saw a spark of interest in Seth’s eyes, and knew he’d hit pay dirt, a
  true connection. The truth that can only be uncovered by shared experience.<br />
  <br />
  “I do,” Seth said, his voice coming out hushed, subconsciously mirroring
  Marcus’ own serious tone. “What’s that got to do with Nazis, though?”<br />
  <br />
  <i>“Everything,”</i> Marcus said, spreading his arms wide. “It’s all
  connected. I’ll tell you the story, if you like.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth still looked a little skeptical, but he’d picked up on Marcus’s serious
  mood. He nodded solemnly.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus mentally girded himself, disciplining his thoughts into order. It was
  hard being a recruiter. He had to bare his soul and confront some heavy shit,
  the dark truths that everyone knew but preferred to ignore. And he had to do
  all that with total conviction and confidence, without flinching away from the
  uncomfortable parts. It opened Marcus up to mockery or attacks or joking
  deflections, but it was necessary. People could sense insincerity a mile away.
  He had to make himself vulnerable to be believed, then build that connection
  up into something strong.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus took a deep breath, and began his story.<br />
  <br />
  “One of my earliest memories was watching TV with my big sister, some cartoon
  or something. Suddenly, the movie cut out, and it started showing the news, so
  my sister tried changing the channel, but it was all the same thing on
  <i>every</i> channel, talking about Jörmungandr appearing for the first time.
  I was just a little kid, I didn’t know what was going on, and Cass wouldn’t
  tell me, so I called out to Mom. She came into the living room, and then she
  just <i>froze</i>. I don’t really remember what the news was saying, but I’ll
  never forget the look on her face. How she went all still and white. Seeing my
  mom, standing there like a statue, just... I could tell she was rooted by pure
  <i>fear, </i>and it scared me more than anything I’d ever seen in my life.
  Then she grabbed both of us, hugging us so hard it <i>hurt,</i> and even
  though she couldn’t stop <i>crying,</i> she still didn’t look away from the
  TV, not even once. We didn’t understand what happened, but it was mom’s
  reaction that made it <i>real</i>. After that, I saw the despair everywhere,
  but I didn’t understand it, what that really <i>meant</i> for the world, not
  until years later.”<br />
  <br />
  As Marcus spoke, he felt chills racing down his body, goosebumps rippling out
  over his arms at reliving the memory.<br />
  <br />
  “Are you talking about Leviathan being the reason for the boat graveyard, and
  the city’s economy getting fucked up?” Seth asked as Marcus took a drink to
  soothe his suddenly dry throat.<br />
  <br />
  “That’s only a tiny part of it. <i>Everything</i> went downhill from there,
  <i>everywhere</i>. You and I, our generation, we could feel it even when we
  were kids, and growing up it only got worse. Think about it—when Jörmungandr
  sank Kyushu, that’s when all the immigrants started flooding in. Not just in
  Brockton Bay with the ABB turning the place into a shithole, there’s
  <i>millions</i> of refugees all over, and it’s only going to get a thousand
  times worse in a few years. So what’s <i>wrong</i> with people? They’re all
  <i>terrified, </i>but they’re pretending that they aren’t. People are too busy
  with sports or celebrities or drugs or whatever pointless, petty bullshit they
  use to distract themselves from thinking.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth nodded. “Oh yeah. It’s all total bullshit, we can agree on that part.
  People would rather have their comfortable lies instead of the hard truth. I
  don’t sign on to all the race stuff, though.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus felt his cheeks flush a little with his frustration, and hoped it
  didn’t show. The pitch had started well, but now it felt like he was losing
  Seth, so he decided to go for one of his trump cards. “About the race stuff, I
  get it. I do. We’ve been taught from birth it’s bad. Kumbaya and give peace a
  chance and all that shit the mass media pushes to keep everyone in line. But
  you can just as easily say <i>fighting</i> is bad. There’s no room for that
  out in the <i>real</i> world, where things like fighting and racism are
  sometimes <i>necessary</i>. I’ve heard it explained this way, and it really
  stuck with me: think of the world like a sinking ship. Your country—as in,
  your culture, that’s the lifeboat.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth raised a skeptical eyebrow. “So you’re saying we’re like the
  <i>Titanic</i>, and the Jews are like the iceberg or something?”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shook his head, resisting the urge to call out Seth’s stupidity. “No,
  not at all. What I mean is, the ship’s like the world, and it’s already
  sinking, there’s nothing we can do to stop it now. Think of white culture as
  the last lifeboat. Everyone knows it’s their best chance, so everyone’s
  flocking to it. But if too many people try to climb on the lifeboat, they’ll
  sink the whole thing for everyone. Sure, you can give up your spot on the boat
  if you want to be <i>nice</i> or whatever, but then you’re just, y’know,
  adding to the problem, because the guy you let on wants to bring
  <i>his</i> family, <i>his</i> friends, and now suddenly everyone’s fighting
  each other instead of defending the boat. The lifeboat sinks, everyone dies,
  and <i>nobody</i> is better off just because you did the ‘nice’ thing. In
  order to survive, we have to <i>fight,</i> and to fight we have to be united
  by something stronger. A shared culture, shared blood. I know no one
  <i>else</i> is going to fight for me, all the other races only ever stick up
  for themselves. So why shouldn’t we?”<br />
  <br />
  Seth shrugged helplessly. “Look, I’m all for protecting my own culture. I
  don’t have any problem with that, and I’m proud to be white too. It’s a good
  thing, right? I don’t know what else to tell you, though. All the Asians can
  fuck right off back to where they came from, but I don’t see the point of
  being so hung up over the blacks and gays and Jews. It just seems... kinda
  pointless, you know?”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shook his head. “I’m sorry if it’s hard to accept, but including blacks
  and gays and whatever else is a luxury we just can’t <i>afford</i>. Black
  people and their problems are a liability in this fight, you don’t have to
  hate them, but that’s just a <i>fact</i>. They’re less than 13% of the
  population, but they commit the majority of the crimes. White people have an
  IQ of 100 and black people have an IQ of 80. That’s just the truth, and it
  won’t change for anybody’s politically correct <i>bullshit</i>. It’s just
  nature, and it’s nobody’s <i>fault,</i> but whose fault it is doesn’t matter.
  What matters is <i>survival,</i> and I’m sorry, but you’re not gonna survive
  if you rely on black people or gay people. Just look at Africa. Just look at
  the Roman Empire.”<br />
  <br />
  “No, no, no. I get that part, but I just... does it <i>have</i> to be all
  swastikas and Sieg heils and shit? I mean, no offense, but like, it seems like
  you’re going too far in the other direction. This isn’t Germany in the ‘30s.
  It feels like you’re all trying to dress up for Halloween or something,” said
  Seth, looking pointedly at the guy at the bar with a swastika tattoo on his
  neck.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus waved his hand dismissively. “What, the symbols and all that? It’s just
  ways for people to rebel, or support their favorite capes in the Empire. The
  symbolism is our way of saying <i>fuck the system. </i>It’s about reclaiming
  our heritage from all the lies and bullshit, and some people...” Marcus
  gestured at Spencer’s iron cross-decorated jacket before continuing, “...Just
  like that it drives the fuckers nuts.”<br />
  <br />
  “Okay, that’s fine, I guess, I’m not against free speech or whatever.” Seth
  said sulkily, taking a swig of his beer.<br />
  <br />
  Nodding equably, Marcus tried to steer things back on track. “Letting people
  just do their own thing is okay when things are good, but we’ve
  <i>tried</i> mashing people from different cultures together, and it just
  <i>doesn’t work</i>. We need to try something else.”<br />
  <br />
  “Man, come on. It’s not like the Nazis had the best track record either, they
  did some pretty fucked up shit too.” said Seth, chuckling dryly. “Like, even
  if all you said was true, killing all the Jews or whatever just doesn’t seem
  like it would <i>help</i> anything, just make things even worse.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus felt a flash of indignation at the jibe. It was genuinely disturbing to
  hear all the old fallacies and talking points trotted out robotically, almost
  verbatim. The sheep <i>always</i> brought it around to the Holocaust, every
  single time.<br />
  <br />
  “History is written by the victors, you know that. You’ve got to think for
  <i>yourself,”</i> Marcus said, the words coming out more snidely than he
  intended. He took a quick, calming breath, and continued in a more mellow
  tone, “Allied propaganda only gets a pass because they won in the end.
  Nowadays, people think of fascism like this one-sided, cartoonish thing, just
  bad guys for Indiana Jones and Uncle Sam to punch. When normal people think of
  Nazis, they think of black-and-white newsreels with Hitler speaking
  passionately in German—but haven’t you ever noticed they never include any
  subtitles? God forbid people hear a translation, or else they might end up
  <i>agreeing</i> with him.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth frowned. “I mean, I’ve never been that into history. I guess I never
  thought about getting the other side of the story,” he conceded.<br />
  <br />
  “Well, don’t just take <i>my</i> word for it,” Marcus said quickly, sensing an
  opportunity. “You should do your own research. You might be surprised by what
  you find. Bottom line, though, the world is in desperate need of
  <i>real</i> heroes and warriors who’ll fight for what’s right.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth sighed, sagging down in his chair, holding his drink between his knees.
  “I dunno, man. You’re right that the world’s fucked, but it feels like you’re
  just getting your hopes up.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned back and smiled. “Look around. You just see a couple of guys
  talking in a bar, right? But don’t underestimate that. The Nazi Party in
  Germany started out as a bunch of passionate guys in a beer hall in Munich,
  and only ten years later they united their country, then they created one of
  the greatest war machines to ever exist. The only reason Germany lost was
  because they were badly outnumbered. Now it it’s starting again, here, in the
  United States, the most powerful country in the world, and this time, we have
  parahumans that level the—”<br />
  <br />
  “There you are, ranting about history <i>again,”</i> Spencer interrupted as he
  walked up from behind Marcus, putting his hands on Marcus’s shoulders and
  shooting a smile at Seth. “I swear, when we’re not drinkin’ or kickin’ Chink
  ass, this nerd’s got his head stuck in some old history book. He’ll talk your
  ear off if you’re not careful.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tilted his head far back to see Spencer. “Did you lose already?”<br />
  <br />
  “Nah, just wanted a smoke break. Liza’ll tan my hide if I light up in here.
  Wanna come with?” Spencer asked, already rummaging for the pack in his jacket
  pockets.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus cocked his head, considering. Seth didn’t smoke, so he wouldn’t be
  joining them, but it would probably be best to let Seth stew on Marcus’s words
  for a bit anyway. “Eh, sure. I could go for one.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus got up and followed Spencer out the door. Rudy and Liza didn’t
  appreciate people smoking out front—both of them were health nuts that hated
  secondhand smoke—so they’d set up a semi-enclosed little stoop in the side
  alley for smokers, with an overhang to ward away the rain and a pair of
  standing ashtrays.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer lit up a cig, and offered Marcus one with the lighter.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus lit his own, and took a lazy drag. Spencer didn’t buy the best
  cigarettes, but at least he avoided the cheapest shit available.<br />
  <br />
  Taking another drag, Marcus tried his best to savor the rich smoke despite the
  chilly night air. He was just about to take another pull when he heard a loud
  <i>thump</i> from nearby, making him cough in surprise.<br />
  <br />
  There was a shuffling sound in the alley, down on the side with the dead end.
  Someone was there the whole time? Marcus peered into the darkness, but it was
  almost impossible to see beyond the cone of wan, yellow light cast by the
  single bulb installed in the overhang. Marcus saw the guy in the shadows
  first, and lightly slapped Spencer’s shoulder, pointing his friend towards the
  newcomer. It was a guy in a hoodie.<br />
  <br />
  "The fuck d’you want?" Spencer asked, a bit muffled from the cigarette he held
  in his lips.<br />
  <br />
  "Are you two Empire Eighty-Eight?” the hooded man asked tersely. He was
  fidgeting and trembling uncontrollably, which Marcus immediately pegged as
  drug withdrawal. As the man stepped closer to the light, Marcus could see he
  had that unmistakable hungry look to him, but he was also wearing Empire
  colors.<br />
  <br />
  That gave Marcus pause, but his confusion resolved as quickly as it had
  arisen. This dude was clearly one of the Merchant’s degenerates, probably
  trying to pick a fight or dress up as one of them and steal some drugs or
  something. The dumbass had picked the <i>worst</i> possible place to do it,
  though.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus and Spencer exchanged a skeptical look before refocusing on the
  junkie.<br />
  <br />
  "Yeah, we’re Empire—but just coming right up and asking, that’s a first," said
  Spencer, smiling humorlessly. "But this ain’t a fuckin’ charity. We don’t give
  freebies to losers on the street just ‘cause they’re white. Fuck off.”<br />
  <br />
  The hoodie guy said nothing, his gaze hawkish and intense. Marcus felt his
  stomach tense at the creepy look in the hooded man’s eyes. He moved closer,
  striding right towards them.<br />
  <br />
  Was this guy for <i>real?</i> He must have been jonesing <i>hard</i> to think
  taking on two-on-one odds was a good idea, even without the gun.<br />
  <br />
  “You asked for it, motherfucker,” Spencer snarled, reaching into his jacket
  and pulling out his huge Ruger Blackhawk revolver. The dark gray metal made it
  almost impossible to see in the dark, but the menacing shape of Spencer’s
  beloved .357 magnum would be unmistakable, even to a junkie.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus didn’t even have time to register what the hooded man was doing when
  his left hand slapped the gun out of Spencer’s grip before he could even cock
  the hammer. In nearly the same instant, the hooded man’s right hand seized
  Spencer by the neck, then he kicked Marcus in the gut with a visceral
  <i>crunch</i> that radiated through Marcus’s whole body. Pain exploded in his
  midsection as he was lifted off his feet by the force of the blow, his back
  slamming into the concrete ashtray and sending him spinning into the
  ground.<br />
  <br />
  After a moment of disorientation, with blinding stars dancing in Marcus’s
  vision, the pain truly hit in full, and he couldn’t even <i>breathe</i>. It
  felt like he’d been broken in <i>half</i>. His stomach and back radiated with
  pure, overwhelming agony, and he curled up on his side, his beers and
  hamburger coming back up, the bitter acid and alcohol burning his throat and
  sinuses.<br />
  <br />
  After the brief convulsion of vomiting ended, Marcus struggled to take the
  smallest of breaths. He blinked the stars out of his streaming eyes only to
  watch as the guy in the hoodie—<i>the unmasked cape, </i>he realized—lifted
  Spencer off his feet by the neck.<br />
  <br />
  The parahuman didn’t even flinch as Spencer flailed and struggled, punching
  his face and clawing at his icy blue eyes. Then, the parahuman’s arms
  <i>transformed</i> somehow, sprouting into a mass of dark, jagged cables that
  stabbed into Spencer’s body, dragging him into the monster whose entire upper
  body split apart into a flurry of countless lashing blades.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer was <i>shredded</i>.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer’s clothes were ripped away and his body burst open like an overfilled
  grocery bag, blood and viscera splattering out of his dismembered body in
  unbelievable quantities. A moment later, the entrails were drawn into the
  monster’s body like food getting sucked down into a blender. Marcus saw a
  pale, mauled section of Spencer’s torso briefly surface from the seething
  mass, the meat and skin stretching obscenely as it was torn away from the
  bloody ribs, and a moment later the dripping, red segment of ribcage was
  crushed back down into the mass of fanged tentacles.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus would have vomited again from sheer <i>terror</i> if he’d had the
  capacity to, but for the moment all he could do was try and fail to breathe.
  Where his vision wasn’t blurry from tears, there was blackness fading in
  around the edges, whether from lack of air or oncoming shock from his
  injury.<br />
  <br />
  There were no thoughts of calling for help or fighting back. Marcus only felt
  bone-deep agony and overwhelming, electrifying fear. The need to be somewhere,
  <i>anywhere</i> else paradoxically froze him in place, as if his body had
  overridden his brain and was trying to hide in plain sight or offer abject
  surrender. Spencer had just <i>died, </i>it was unbelievable, it didn’t make
  any <i>sense,</i> this place was supposed to be <i>safe</i>—but Marcus was
  certain that he was next.<br />
  <br />
  The monster was resolving into a humanoid shape again. The thing compressed
  itself, crunching down and ejecting spurts of blood and chunks of gore like a
  squeezed sponge as it shrank down to the size and shape of a human again.
  Marcus felt the hot wetness splatter over him, but didn’t dare blink or look
  away.<br />
  <br />
  In moments, the tentacled thing had molded back together like clay and changed
  color to become the hooded figure once more, clothes and all. It was
  spotlessly clean despite standing in a huge, spreading pool of blood and bits
  of Spencer that cascaded down the short steps and into the alley beyond.<br />
  <br />
  “Damn,” said the monster wearing human skin. “All that and I’m still
  hungry.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus could hardly believe his own ears. The thing sounded mildly
  disappointed, almost <i>bored,</i> like he’d gotten the wrong order at a
  drive-thru.<br />
  <br />
  He killed Spencer and <i>that</i> was all he had to say?<br />
  <br />
  That spark of rage was what finally broke Marcus free from the paralysis of
  terror.<br />
  <br />
  He couldn’t move much, but he saw where Spencer’s Ruger had clattered against
  the wall and fallen nearby. With a desperate adrenaline-fueled lunge that
  ignited the pain in his back, Marcus grabbed the gun and aimed—<br />
  <br />
  There was a blur of motion, a tight feeling in his arm and shoulder. His arm
  moved <i>wrongly,</i> the angles not matching.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus saw his right forearm falling in four pieces from the bloody stump of
  his elbow. Blood fountained from the stump, the warm wetness spreading over
  his shirt. It just felt numb.<br />
  <br />
  looking up, Marcus saw that the monster had transformed its fingers into long,
  thin, scythe-like claws that were almost hypnotic in the effortless,
  quicksilver way they moved, like the swaying of a cobra about to strike. He
  looked away from the claws, and met the thing’s pale, dead eyes. There was no
  anger, no regret, no humanity, just <i>hunger</i>. The thing didn’t even care
  at all that Marcus was a human being, he realized in an instant of
  understanding. It just saw Marcus as an acceptable target.<br />
  <br />
  Then the pain hit in earnest, a searing fire in Marcus’s shoulder and arm. He
  let out what little breath he’d had left in a shuddering moan as he clutched
  the stump close to his chest.<br />
  <br />
  No. No. No. <i>No</i>. This couldn’t be happening. Not here. He had to get
  away...<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tried to move, but he couldn’t. He was too weak. He hurt so, so much,
  he was so tired. All he wanted was to go to sleep, and not have to deal with
  this pain anymore. He wanted to go to sleep and wake up in bed back home, back
  with his family.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus squeezed his eyes shut, tears spilling out. He remembered all the
  stupid arguments he had with his family, how much they begged him to stay home
  and not join the Empire.<br />
  <br />
  <i>I’m sorry, Mom. I’m sorry, Cass.</i><br />
  <br />
  The last thing Marcus felt besides the pain and regret was the sensation of
  being lifted up off the ground.<br />
  <br />
  <b
    >A/N <br />
    Still with me after this chapter? Good. I was really nervous about this one,
    for obvious reasons. Humanizing Nazis and depicting their propaganda is
    always a perilous thing, although it is vitally important to the story to do
    so, for reasons that will become clear later. Needless to say, the opinions
    of the characters do not reflect the author’s, yadda yadda. Marcus is
    supposed to come off as a jumped-up know-nothing wehraboo and a hypocrite,
    but still just a scared, misguided teen underneath. I hope that came
    through.<br />
    <br />
    In other news, I have launched a new contest! It can be found under the
    Apocrypha thread. I can announce here that two prizes have been claimed thus
    far—congratulations again to TheLastOne, who won a bespoke chapter and
    requested a Regent interlude (timing TBD). I must also congratulate the new
    winner, InfiniteTangent, whose correct answer has won everyone a bonus
    chapter coming out this upcoming Tuesday. Thanks to everyone who

  <b>Infection 2.M</b><br />
  <br />
  Marcus lounged in the Eagle’s Nest, slowly sinking into one of the bar’s
  comfortable leather couches. He was nursing his second tall glass of beer that
  night, mindful not to let the pleasant buzz muddle his thoughts. He wanted his
  mind to stay relatively sharp, but also keep the atmosphere relaxed. Marcus
  was admittedly a lightweight, in more ways than one, and it didn’t take much
  alcohol to get a good buzz going—unlike his best friend Spencer, who sat in a
  matching armchair to his left.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer charitably described himself as ‘husky,’ in stark contrast to Marcus,
  and as a result Spencer could pound away drinks all night long and barely show
  it. He was currently demolishing a fourth beer. That was fine, since he wasn’t
  here to do the talking anyway. Spencer was around more to provide Marcus moral
  support and, admittedly, to complement him with a more normal and less serious
  side of things. It had been Spencer’s idea to invite the third member of their
  little group.<br />
  <br />
  On Marcus’s right sat Seth, the younger brother of an old high school friend
  of Spencer’s. Seth might have been okay with drinking alongside Spencer and
  Marcus—at least partly because he couldn’t get easy access to booze anywhere
  else—but he wasn’t a member of the Empire Eighty-Eight like Spencer and Marcus
  were. Marcus hoped to change that tonight. He had been noticed for his budding
  talent at changing minds, having brought two other members into the Empire in
  just six months, and adding a third would help him move up in the
  organization.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tended to prefer the deep and serious approach to recruitment, but
  Spencer was good at just making friends. He often reminded Marcus of a dog, in
  both good and bad ways. Spencer was friendly, silly, and a bit too fond of
  food, but he was brave and loyal when it counted the most. Marcus couldn’t
  have asked for a better friend, or a better partner in crime to try winning
  over hearts and minds. Spencer could handle the heart, while Marcus would
  target the mind.<br />
  <br />
  Seth had started out nervous when he’d entered the bar, but with the help of
  Spencer’s happy-go-lucky teasing and antics, he’d mellowed out considerably.
  That was good—it would make the next part easier.<br />
  <br />
  “What’s with the dopey smile?” Spencer asked Marcus.<br />
  <br />
  “Just thinkin’ about days gone by. You know. High school. How glad I am to put
  that shit behind me,” said Marcus, smirking at Seth before taking another sip
  of beer.<br />
  <br />
  “Yeah, man. Ancient history,” Seth responded with heavy irony, conveniently
  ignoring that he was 17 and still a senior at Winslow High.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer snorted. “Oh, fuck off with your <i>ancient history</i>. If it weren’t
  for us vouching for you, Liza would have tossed you out on your ass for
  showing up with that two-bit fake I.D.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth gestured at Marcus. “He’s only one grade ahead of me, why aren’t you
  getting on <i>his</i> case?”<br />
  <br />
  “It’s not about drinking age, it’s about who you <i>know</i>. Marcus and I are
  members of the club. You’re just our guest,” Spencer said sagely.<br />
  <br />
  “Come on, Spence,” Marcus gently chided. “He’s just here to relax and have a
  good time. This isn’t a members-only bar.”<br />
  <br />
  Spencer scoffed. “Like hell it isn’t! Look around, do you see
  <i>anyone</i> who’s not white?”<br />
  <br />
  “It’s more than just that. If all they did was keep out Merchants and homeless
  trash, that would be kind of a low bar,” Marcus pointed out.<br />
  <br />
  “Pun intended, right? You get weird when you drink, I ever tell you that? All
  serious and philly-<i>philosophical</i>. It’s fuckin’... nerdy as shit.”
  Spencer said, stumbling a bit over his words.<br />
  <br />
  “Whereas <i>you</i> get all tongue-tied,” Marcus deadpanned.<br />
  <br />
  “I’ll have you know I’m fluent in sign language too, jackass.” said Spencer,
  flipping Marcus the bird and then launching into an elaborate pantomime with a
  lot of pointing and unintelligible arm-chopping motions.<br />
  <br />
  “The hell are you even doing?” Seth laughed.<br />
  <br />
  “Lettin’ Marcus know he’s a sad little stick-in-the-mud.” said Spencer,
  stopping his wild gestures.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shrugged. Spencer’s teasing had long since stopped making him feel
  offended, not when he knew Spencer wasn’t really serious and tried to insult
  just about everyone he thought he could get away with.<br />
  <br />
  “Come on, you fuckin’ <i>lump</i>. Don’t you at least wanna play pool or
  something?” Spencer wheedled. He could be surprisingly shrewish for a guy with
  a beer belly and deep baritone voice.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus rolled his eyes. “Even <i>sober</i> you couldn’t hit the broad side of
  a barn, much less a billiard ball. Maybe try your luck with Landon over there,
  he looks like he can barely stand. If you can beat him, get back to me.”<br />
  <br />
  Spencer stood up and walked off, muttering. “I dunno why I hang around with
  such a stuck-up little toothpick.”<br />
  <br />
  Chuckling at his friend, Marcus settled back, relaxing. He let the sounds of
  the room wash over him, the charging beat of the rock music playing at medium
  volume in the background, the murmur of the crowd, the clink of glasses and
  silverware. He loved relaxing at the Eagle’s Nest. It was a safe haven full of
  simple pleasures, a stress-free environment compared to the howling goddamn
  insanity that was Brockton Bay.<br />
  <br />
  Seth, however, was fidgeting and seemed quite restless. His fear at being
  busted for underage drinking had evaporated, but he still looked like he
  didn’t quite know what to do with himself in this place where he stuck out
  like a sore thumb. He was the only one in the whole bar with shoulder-length
  brown hair, everyone else was either a natural or dyed blonde like Marcus, or
  a skinhead like Spencer.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus waited patiently. The topic of the Empire’s ideology was going to come
  up eventually. People didn’t listen when you tried to shove your worldview
  down their throats, they just got defensive and shut down, he knew that much
  from bitter experience with his mom and sister. If you just left the door open
  and answered their questions, though, they’d be a lot more receptive to what
  you had to say.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus’s gaze fell on the elaborately wrought iron eagle mounted in the corner
  near the ceiling, holding the corners of two flags in its claws. One was the
  Imperial German war ensign, the other an Iron Cross on a black background. It
  made Marcus feel a warm flush of pride.<br />
  <br />
  “Hey, Marcus. What are you thinking about?” Seth finally asked.<br />
  <br />
  “Just appreciating the vexillolography,” Marcus said, nodding at the flag.<br />
  <br />
  “Gesundheit,” said Seth, raising an eyebrow.<br />
  <br />
  “It means the art of the flags. There’s a lot of meaning behind every element
  in the colors and symbols.” Marcus said.<br />
  <br />
  “I’ve been meaning to ask you about that—not the flag, I mean, but all the
  Nazi stuff. Like, I know the Nazis had some cool shit and all, but I don’t get
  why you and your, uh, <i>friends</i> are all gung-ho about them. You’re not
  even German.” Seth pointed out.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus chuckled, leaning forward. “You know, I’m <i>so</i> glad you asked
  about the <i>good news...!”</i> he said with mock brightness, doing his best
  door-knocking evangelist impression.<br />
  <br />
  “Oh, God, spare me the sales pitch. Forget I said anything!” said Seth,
  covering his eyes.<br />
  <br />
  They both laughed together, in that un-self-conscious way that only partially
  inebriated people could manage.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned back, sighing after the laughing fit passed. “Seriously, though,
  dude. I won’t push, but do you really want to know?”<br />
  <br />
  Seth shrugged. “I mean, kinda? I’ve always been more interested in the biker
  and metalhead scenes, but if you hang out around those long enough, you pick
  up a thing or two. I don’t really get it, though. I mean, don’t get me wrong,
  I hate those ABB motherfuckers, but I don’t get the jump from that to, like,
  full-on Nazis.”<br />
  <br />
  “I think you understand more than you think,” Marcus said, holding up a hand.
  “Maybe it’ll help to give you an example. For me, I started coming around when
  I began noticing that something was really wrong with the world.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth scoffed. “There’s a <i>lot</i> wrong with the world. There’s wars and
  Endbringers and the Water Crisis and all that shit.”<br />
  <br />
  “I mean besides the obvious. There’s something rotten with
  <i>normal</i> people, the way they think and act. You know, just culture in
  general,” Marcus pressed, waving a finger in a circle as if to encompass the
  whole world. “Didn’t everything seem so much more hopeful when we were kids? I
  mean, we were both born after the Golden Age of Superheroes ended, but things
  weren’t so bad on the surface. Behemoth came around before I could really
  remember, but people didn’t really know what that had <i>meant</i> yet. Do you
  remember when Jörmungandr first appeared?”<br />
  <br />
  “Who?” asked Seth, his brow knitting in confusion.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned in closer, quietly listing off the names of the beast.
  “Jörmungandr. The Second. The Serpent. <i>Leviathan</i>.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus saw a spark of interest in Seth’s eyes, and knew he’d hit pay dirt, a
  true connection. The truth that can only be uncovered by shared experience.<br />
  <br />
  “I do,” Seth said, his voice coming out hushed, subconsciously mirroring
  Marcus’ own serious tone. “What’s that got to do with Nazis, though?”<br />
  <br />
  <i>“Everything,”</i> Marcus said, spreading his arms wide. “It’s all
  connected. I’ll tell you the story, if you like.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth still looked a little skeptical, but he’d picked up on Marcus’s serious
  mood. He nodded solemnly.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus mentally girded himself, disciplining his thoughts into order. It was
  hard being a recruiter. He had to bare his soul and confront some heavy shit,
  the dark truths that everyone knew but preferred to ignore. And he had to do
  all that with total conviction and confidence, without flinching away from the
  uncomfortable parts. It opened Marcus up to mockery or attacks or joking
  deflections, but it was necessary. People could sense insincerity a mile away.
  He had to make himself vulnerable to be believed, then build that connection
  up into something strong.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus took a deep breath, and began his story.<br />
  <br />
  “One of my earliest memories was watching TV with my big sister, some cartoon
  or something. Suddenly, the movie cut out, and it started showing the news, so
  my sister tried changing the channel, but it was all the same thing on
  <i>every</i> channel, talking about Jörmungandr appearing for the first time.
  I was just a little kid, I didn’t know what was going on, and Cass wouldn’t
  tell me, so I called out to Mom. She came into the living room, and then she
  just <i>froze</i>. I don’t really remember what the news was saying, but I’ll
  never forget the look on her face. How she went all still and white. Seeing my
  mom, standing there like a statue, just... I could tell she was rooted by pure
  <i>fear, </i>and it scared me more than anything I’d ever seen in my life.
  Then she grabbed both of us, hugging us so hard it <i>hurt,</i> and even
  though she couldn’t stop <i>crying,</i> she still didn’t look away from the
  TV, not even once. We didn’t understand what happened, but it was mom’s
  reaction that made it <i>real</i>. After that, I saw the despair everywhere,
  but I didn’t understand it, what that really <i>meant</i> for the world, not
  until years later.”<br />
  <br />
  As Marcus spoke, he felt chills racing down his body, goosebumps rippling out
  over his arms at reliving the memory.<br />
  <br />
  “Are you talking about Leviathan being the reason for the boat graveyard, and
  the city’s economy getting fucked up?” Seth asked as Marcus took a drink to
  soothe his suddenly dry throat.<br />
  <br />
  “That’s only a tiny part of it. <i>Everything</i> went downhill from there,
  <i>everywhere</i>. You and I, our generation, we could feel it even when we
  were kids, and growing up it only got worse. Think about it—when Jörmungandr
  sank Kyushu, that’s when all the immigrants started flooding in. Not just in
  Brockton Bay with the ABB turning the place into a shithole, there’s
  <i>millions</i> of refugees all over, and it’s only going to get a thousand
  times worse in a few years. So what’s <i>wrong</i> with people? They’re all
  <i>terrified, </i>but they’re pretending that they aren’t. People are too busy
  with sports or celebrities or drugs or whatever pointless, petty bullshit they
  use to distract themselves from thinking.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth nodded. “Oh yeah. It’s all total bullshit, we can agree on that part.
  People would rather have their comfortable lies instead of the hard truth. I
  don’t sign on to all the race stuff, though.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus felt his cheeks flush a little with his frustration, and hoped it
  didn’t show. The pitch had started well, but now it felt like he was losing
  Seth, so he decided to go for one of his trump cards. “About the race stuff, I
  get it. I do. We’ve been taught from birth it’s bad. Kumbaya and give peace a
  chance and all that shit the mass media pushes to keep everyone in line. But
  you can just as easily say <i>fighting</i> is bad. There’s no room for that
  out in the <i>real</i> world, where things like fighting and racism are
  sometimes <i>necessary</i>. I’ve heard it explained this way, and it really
  stuck with me: think of the world like a sinking ship. Your country—as in,
  your culture, that’s the lifeboat.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth raised a skeptical eyebrow. “So you’re saying we’re like the
  <i>Titanic</i>, and the Jews are like the iceberg or something?”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shook his head, resisting the urge to call out Seth’s stupidity. “No,
  not at all. What I mean is, the ship’s like the world, and it’s already
  sinking, there’s nothing we can do to stop it now. Think of white culture as
  the last lifeboat. Everyone knows it’s their best chance, so everyone’s
  flocking to it. But if too many people try to climb on the lifeboat, they’ll
  sink the whole thing for everyone. Sure, you can give up your spot on the boat
  if you want to be <i>nice</i> or whatever, but then you’re just, y’know,
  adding to the problem, because the guy you let on wants to bring
  <i>his</i> family, <i>his</i> friends, and now suddenly everyone’s fighting
  each other instead of defending the boat. The lifeboat sinks, everyone dies,
  and <i>nobody</i> is better off just because you did the ‘nice’ thing. In
  order to survive, we have to <i>fight,</i> and to fight we have to be united
  by something stronger. A shared culture, shared blood. I know no one
  <i>else</i> is going to fight for me, all the other races only ever stick up
  for themselves. So why shouldn’t we?”<br />
  <br />
  Seth shrugged helplessly. “Look, I’m all for protecting my own culture. I
  don’t have any problem with that, and I’m proud to be white too. It’s a good
  thing, right? I don’t know what else to tell you, though. All the Asians can
  fuck right off back to where they came from, but I don’t see the point of
  being so hung up over the blacks and gays and Jews. It just seems... kinda
  pointless, you know?”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus shook his head. “I’m sorry if it’s hard to accept, but including blacks
  and gays and whatever else is a luxury we just can’t <i>afford</i>. Black
  people and their problems are a liability in this fight, you don’t have to
  hate them, but that’s just a <i>fact</i>. They’re less than 13% of the
  population, but they commit the majority of the crimes. White people have an
  IQ of 100 and black people have an IQ of 80. That’s just the truth, and it
  won’t change for anybody’s politically correct <i>bullshit</i>. It’s just
  nature, and it’s nobody’s <i>fault,</i> but whose fault it is doesn’t matter.
  What matters is <i>survival,</i> and I’m sorry, but you’re not gonna survive
  if you rely on black people or gay people. Just look at Africa. Just look at
  the Roman Empire.”<br />
  <br />
  “No, no, no. I get that part, but I just... does it <i>have</i> to be all
  swastikas and Sieg heils and shit? I mean, no offense, but like, it seems like
  you’re going too far in the other direction. This isn’t Germany in the ‘30s.
  It feels like you’re all trying to dress up for Halloween or something,” said
  Seth, looking pointedly at the guy at the bar with a swastika tattoo on his
  neck.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus waved his hand dismissively. “What, the symbols and all that? It’s just
  ways for people to rebel, or support their favorite capes in the Empire. The
  symbolism is our way of saying <i>fuck the system. </i>It’s about reclaiming
  our heritage from all the lies and bullshit, and some people...” Marcus
  gestured at Spencer’s iron cross-decorated jacket before continuing, “...Just
  like that it drives the fuckers nuts.”<br />
  <br />
  “Okay, that’s fine, I guess, I’m not against free speech or whatever.” Seth
  said sulkily, taking a swig of his beer.<br />
  <br />
  Nodding equably, Marcus tried to steer things back on track. “Letting people
  just do their own thing is okay when things are good, but we’ve
  <i>tried</i> mashing people from different cultures together, and it just
  <i>doesn’t work</i>. We need to try something else.”<br />
  <br />
  “Man, come on. It’s not like the Nazis had the best track record either, they
  did some pretty fucked up shit too.” said Seth, chuckling dryly. “Like, even
  if all you said was true, killing all the Jews or whatever just doesn’t seem
  like it would <i>help</i> anything, just make things even worse.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus felt a flash of indignation at the jibe. It was genuinely disturbing to
  hear all the old fallacies and talking points trotted out robotically, almost
  verbatim. The sheep <i>always</i> brought it around to the Holocaust, every
  single time.<br />
  <br />
  “History is written by the victors, you know that. You’ve got to think for
  <i>yourself,”</i> Marcus said, the words coming out more snidely than he
  intended. He took a quick, calming breath, and continued in a more mellow
  tone, “Allied propaganda only gets a pass because they won in the end.
  Nowadays, people think of fascism like this one-sided, cartoonish thing, just
  bad guys for Indiana Jones and Uncle Sam to punch. When normal people think of
  Nazis, they think of black-and-white newsreels with Hitler speaking
  passionately in German—but haven’t you ever noticed they never include any
  subtitles? God forbid people hear a translation, or else they might end up
  <i>agreeing</i> with him.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth frowned. “I mean, I’ve never been that into history. I guess I never
  thought about getting the other side of the story,” he conceded.<br />
  <br />
  “Well, don’t just take <i>my</i> word for it,” Marcus said quickly, sensing an
  opportunity. “You should do your own research. You might be surprised by what
  you find. Bottom line, though, the world is in desperate need of
  <i>real</i> heroes and warriors who’ll fight for what’s right.”<br />
  <br />
  Seth sighed, sagging down in his chair, holding his drink between his knees.
  “I dunno, man. You’re right that the world’s fucked, but it feels like you’re
  just getting your hopes up.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus leaned back and smiled. “Look around. You just see a couple of guys
  talking in a bar, right? But don’t underestimate that. The Nazi Party in
  Germany started out as a bunch of passionate guys in a beer hall in Munich,
  and only ten years later they united their country, then they created one of
  the greatest war machines to ever exist. The only reason Germany lost was
  because they were badly outnumbered. Now it it’s starting again, here, in the
  United States, the most powerful country in the world, and this time, we have
  parahumans that level the—”<br />
  <br />
  “There you are, ranting about history <i>again,”</i> Spencer interrupted as he
  walked up from behind Marcus, putting his hands on Marcus’s shoulders and
  shooting a smile at Seth. “I swear, when we’re not drinkin’ or kickin’ Chink
  ass, this nerd’s got his head stuck in some old history book. He’ll talk your
  ear off if you’re not careful.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tilted his head far back to see Spencer. “Did you lose already?”<br />
  <br />
  “Nah, just wanted a smoke break. Liza’ll tan my hide if I light up in here.
  Wanna come with?” Spencer asked, already rummaging for the pack in his jacket
  pockets.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus cocked his head, considering. Seth didn’t smoke, so he wouldn’t be
  joining them, but it would probably be best to let Seth stew on Marcus’s words
  for a bit anyway. “Eh, sure. I could go for one.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus got up and followed Spencer out the door. Rudy and Liza didn’t
  appreciate people smoking out front—both of them were health nuts that hated
  secondhand smoke—so they’d set up a semi-enclosed little stoop in the side
  alley for smokers, with an overhang to ward away the rain and a pair of
  standing ashtrays.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer lit up a cig, and offered Marcus one with the lighter.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus lit his own, and took a lazy drag. Spencer didn’t buy the best
  cigarettes, but at least he avoided the cheapest shit available.<br />
  <br />
  Taking another drag, Marcus tried his best to savor the rich smoke despite the
  chilly night air. He was just about to take another pull when he heard a loud
  <i>thump</i> from nearby, making him cough in surprise.<br />
  <br />
  There was a shuffling sound in the alley, down on the side with the dead end.
  Someone was there the whole time? Marcus peered into the darkness, but it was
  almost impossible to see beyond the cone of wan, yellow light cast by the
  single bulb installed in the overhang. Marcus saw the guy in the shadows
  first, and lightly slapped Spencer’s shoulder, pointing his friend towards the
  newcomer. It was a guy in a hoodie.<br />
  <br />
  "The fuck d’you want?" Spencer asked, a bit muffled from the cigarette he held
  in his lips.<br />
  <br />
  "Are you two Empire Eighty-Eight?” the hooded man asked tersely. He was
  fidgeting and trembling uncontrollably, which Marcus immediately pegged as
  drug withdrawal. As the man stepped closer to the light, Marcus could see he
  had that unmistakable hungry look to him, but he was also wearing Empire
  colors.<br />
  <br />
  That gave Marcus pause, but his confusion resolved as quickly as it had
  arisen. This dude was clearly one of the Merchant’s degenerates, probably
  trying to pick a fight or dress up as one of them and steal some drugs or
  something. The dumbass had picked the <i>worst</i> possible place to do it,
  though.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus and Spencer exchanged a skeptical look before refocusing on the
  junkie.<br />
  <br />
  "Yeah, we’re Empire—but just coming right up and asking, that’s a first," said
  Spencer, smiling humorlessly. "But this ain’t a fuckin’ charity. We don’t give
  freebies to losers on the street just ‘cause they’re white. Fuck off.”<br />
  <br />
  The hoodie guy said nothing, his gaze hawkish and intense. Marcus felt his
  stomach tense at the creepy look in the hooded man’s eyes. He moved closer,
  striding right towards them.<br />
  <br />
  Was this guy for <i>real?</i> He must have been jonesing <i>hard</i> to think
  taking on two-on-one odds was a good idea, even without the gun.<br />
  <br />
  “You asked for it, motherfucker,” Spencer snarled, reaching into his jacket
  and pulling out his huge Ruger Blackhawk revolver. The dark gray metal made it
  almost impossible to see in the dark, but the menacing shape of Spencer’s
  beloved .357 magnum would be unmistakable, even to a junkie.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus didn’t even have time to register what the hooded man was doing when
  his left hand slapped the gun out of Spencer’s grip before he could even cock
  the hammer. In nearly the same instant, the hooded man’s right hand seized
  Spencer by the neck, then he kicked Marcus in the gut with a visceral
  <i>crunch</i> that radiated through Marcus’s whole body. Pain exploded in his
  midsection as he was lifted off his feet by the force of the blow, his back
  slamming into the concrete ashtray and sending him spinning into the
  ground.<br />
  <br />
  After a moment of disorientation, with blinding stars dancing in Marcus’s
  vision, the pain truly hit in full, and he couldn’t even <i>breathe</i>. It
  felt like he’d been broken in <i>half</i>. His stomach and back radiated with
  pure, overwhelming agony, and he curled up on his side, his beers and
  hamburger coming back up, the bitter acid and alcohol burning his throat and
  sinuses.<br />
  <br />
  After the brief convulsion of vomiting ended, Marcus struggled to take the
  smallest of breaths. He blinked the stars out of his streaming eyes only to
  watch as the guy in the hoodie—<i>the unmasked cape, </i>he realized—lifted
  Spencer off his feet by the neck.<br />
  <br />
  The parahuman didn’t even flinch as Spencer flailed and struggled, punching
  his face and clawing at his icy blue eyes. Then, the parahuman’s arms
  <i>transformed</i> somehow, sprouting into a mass of dark, jagged cables that
  stabbed into Spencer’s body, dragging him into the monster whose entire upper
  body split apart into a flurry of countless lashing blades.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer was <i>shredded</i>.<br />
  <br />
  Spencer’s clothes were ripped away and his body burst open like an overfilled
  grocery bag, blood and viscera splattering out of his dismembered body in
  unbelievable quantities. A moment later, the entrails were drawn into the
  monster’s body like food getting sucked down into a blender. Marcus saw a
  pale, mauled section of Spencer’s torso briefly surface from the seething
  mass, the meat and skin stretching obscenely as it was torn away from the
  bloody ribs, and a moment later the dripping, red segment of ribcage was
  crushed back down into the mass of fanged tentacles.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus would have vomited again from sheer <i>terror</i> if he’d had the
  capacity to, but for the moment all he could do was try and fail to breathe.
  Where his vision wasn’t blurry from tears, there was blackness fading in
  around the edges, whether from lack of air or oncoming shock from his
  injury.<br />
  <br />
  There were no thoughts of calling for help or fighting back. Marcus only felt
  bone-deep agony and overwhelming, electrifying fear. The need to be somewhere,
  <i>anywhere</i> else paradoxically froze him in place, as if his body had
  overridden his brain and was trying to hide in plain sight or offer abject
  surrender. Spencer had just <i>died, </i>it was unbelievable, it didn’t make
  any <i>sense,</i> this place was supposed to be <i>safe</i>—but Marcus was
  certain that he was next.<br />
  <br />
  The monster was resolving into a humanoid shape again. The thing compressed
  itself, crunching down and ejecting spurts of blood and chunks of gore like a
  squeezed sponge as it shrank down to the size and shape of a human again.
  Marcus felt the hot wetness splatter over him, but didn’t dare blink or look
  away.<br />
  <br />
  In moments, the tentacled thing had molded back together like clay and changed
  color to become the hooded figure once more, clothes and all. It was
  spotlessly clean despite standing in a huge, spreading pool of blood and bits
  of Spencer that cascaded down the short steps and into the alley beyond.<br />
  <br />
  “Damn,” said the monster wearing human skin. “All that and I’m still
  hungry.”<br />
  <br />
  Marcus could hardly believe his own ears. The thing sounded mildly
  disappointed, almost <i>bored,</i> like he’d gotten the wrong order at a
  drive-thru.<br />
  <br />
  He killed Spencer and <i>that</i> was all he had to say?<br />
  <br />
  That spark of rage was what finally broke Marcus free from the paralysis of
  terror.<br />
  <br />
  He couldn’t move much, but he saw where Spencer’s Ruger had clattered against
  the wall and fallen nearby. With a desperate adrenaline-fueled lunge that
  ignited the pain in his back, Marcus grabbed the gun and aimed—<br />
  <br />
  There was a blur of motion, a tight feeling in his arm and shoulder. His arm
  moved <i>wrongly,</i> the angles not matching.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus saw his right forearm falling in four pieces from the bloody stump of
  his elbow. Blood fountained from the stump, the warm wetness spreading over
  his shirt. It just felt numb.<br />
  <br />
  looking up, Marcus saw that the monster had transformed its fingers into long,
  thin, scythe-like claws that were almost hypnotic in the effortless,
  quicksilver way they moved, like the swaying of a cobra about to strike. He
  looked away from the claws, and met the thing’s pale, dead eyes. There was no
  anger, no regret, no humanity, just <i>hunger</i>. The thing didn’t even care
  at all that Marcus was a human being, he realized in an instant of
  understanding. It just saw Marcus as an acceptable target.<br />
  <br />
  Then the pain hit in earnest, a searing fire in Marcus’s shoulder and arm. He
  let out what little breath he’d had left in a shuddering moan as he clutched
  the stump close to his chest.<br />
  <br />
  No. No. No. <i>No</i>. This couldn’t be happening. Not here. He had to get
  away...<br />
  <br />
  Marcus tried to move, but he couldn’t. He was too weak. He hurt so, so much,
  he was so tired. All he wanted was to go to sleep, and not have to deal with
  this pain anymore. He wanted to go to sleep and wake up in bed back home, back
  with his family.<br />
  <br />
  Marcus squeezed his eyes shut, tears spilling out. He remembered all the
  stupid arguments he had with his family, how much they begged him to stay home
  and not join the Empire.<br />
  <br />
  <i>I’m sorry, Mom. I’m sorry, Cass.</i><br />
  <br />
  The last thing Marcus felt besides the pain and regret was the sensation of
  being lifted up off the ground.<br />
  <br />

    >A/N <br />
    Still with me after this chapter? Good. I was really nervous about this one,
    for obvious reasons. Humanizing Nazis and depicting their propaganda is
    always a perilous thing, although it is vitally important to the story to do
    so, for reasons that will become clear later. Needless to say, the opinions
    of the characters do not reflect the author’s, yadda yadda. Marcus is
    supposed to come off as a jumped-up know-nothing wehraboo and a hypocrite,
    but still just a scared, misguided teen underneath. I hope that came
    through.<br />

    In other news, I have launched a new contest! It can be found under the
    Apocrypha thread. I can announce here that two prizes have been claimed thus
    far—congratulations again to TheLastOne, who won a bespoke chapter and
    requested a Regent interlude (timing TBD). I must also congratulate the new
    winner, InfiniteTangent, whose correct answer has won everyone a bonus
    chapter coming out this upcoming Tuesday. Thanks to everyone who
    participated! Your guesses are extremely valuable to me, for gauging my
    audience’s expectations!</b

<br/>
"Don't let that Rat Get Away!"<br/>
<br/>
Scritchet ducked under a high railing as the Beard things chased after him, their rifles cracking the air and sending lead flying after him.<br/>
<br/>
He was hurt, bad-bad. The man-thing had managed to put a shot into his left thigh, and he was only managing to scurry away by virtue of supporting it with his tail.<br/>
<br/>
With a heave, he threw himself out the main gate to where the beard things were all still focused on clearing out the slave corpses. The alert hadn't gotten out from inside the big fortress yet, that was good-good. They didn't seem to notice as he scrabbled up the front of a big beard-thing statue.<br/>
<br/>
He paused for a moment to consider the merits of using the statues eyesocket as a toilet before a shout came up from the deck far below and heavy lead shots started ricocheting off of the stone around him.<br/>
<br/>
A glance back told him that the very irate dwarf engineer who had known the pirate thing's admiral had hobbled all the way out onto the deck and started shooting at him.<br/>
<br/>
'die-die already!' he cursed mentally as he swung up to another section, hoping the stone would shelter him from the hail of fire. Clan Skryre had assured him that the poison in that smoke bomb was enough to kill beard things, but maybe they were just cheap liars.<br/>
<br/>
'they pay good warpstone at least.' Scritchet grumbled as he scrambled into the steaming jungle. The self-proclaimed Lord's of Skavenblight had been his backers on this little mission, apparently by some means they had discovered that the vampire Karl had extracted unholy amounts of Warpstone from the city of Mordheim after flooding the warrens there. The Warlock engineers were pretty sure that he still had it, and wanted it to give them an advantage in the endless civil wars between Pestilens, Moulder, and Skryre.<br/>
<br/>
Scritchet ducked into the tiny cave that Mitchet and he had set up as a home base. Mitchet wasn't back yet, and given that he had been supposed to kill the hunt-thing…<br/>
<br/>
Well, more pay for Scritchet.<br/>
<br/>
With a few flicks to some levers on the big brass box that they had brought with them, and a kick to the antenna, which started spitting green lightning between its prongs, the so-called farsqueaker flared to life.<br/>
<br/>
"This-this is Scritchet, reporting from Sartosa with spy-spy information, for Ikit Claw-Claw!" Scritchet took the opportunity to glance down at his leg. The wound didn't look good. He grabbed some bandages and quickly began to wrap it while he waited for a response on the farsqueaker.<br/>
<br/>
"Ikit Claw is busy-working right now, tell me your message and I take it to him." A high pitched voice, not Ikit, responded.<br/>
<br/>
"Do you think me-me fool? Take to Claw or I no talk-talk." Scritchet replied angrily. Didn't they know this was urgent?<br/>
<br/>
"You no talk to Claw Claw unless you talk to me-m-auork" the Rat's words were cut off with a choking sound, followed by an electrical tearing noise.<br/>
<br/>
"This Ikit, agent Scritchet report, where is the Pi-pirate!" The deeper voiced Skaven ordered immediately over the dying gasps of the previous talker.<br/>
<br/>
"Sir, Beard things think he sail-sailed into Maelstrom, big spooky whirlpool, all pirate things fear-fear it."<br/>
<br/>
"..." There was an uncomfortable silence over the line for a few long moments, punctuated only by the last dying gasps of his previous conversation partner. Finally, Ikit spoke again. "That's Mad-mad and sounds exactly like that dead-thing. I will send a big fleet-fleet. With that much Warpstone Skryre will win-win big war."<br/>
<br/>
"And Eshin will get pay?"<br/>
<br/>
"Yes-yes, Eshin will get much-much warpstone for information. You done well-well." Ikit growled, sounding rather displeased with the necessity of actually paying Eschin anything. "I will speak-squeak with Deathmaster."<br/>
<br/>
"Good-good." Scritchet nodded. As the successful agent, Eschin would give him much warpstone, and he would be promoted up the line of assassins, perhaps even to master rank if Deathmaster felt generous-kind!<br/>
<br/>
"I have Fleet-fleet to prepare, warpstone to find-find, go back to Eshin hold and you will get your pay," Ikit said, before the line cut out and the farsqueaker in front of him spontaneously combusted.<br/>
<br/>
Scritchet grinned, he could already taste the warpstone, all he had to do was get off this island and…<br/>
<br/>
"My, my, my, so the little pirate made off with enough Warpstone to have a fleet sent after him."<br/>
<br/>
Scritchet froze as a woman-thing's voice echoed through his little cave. He drew out his daggers at once, sniffing the air. "Who there? How you find me-me!?!" He demanded, spinning his daggers in his hands.<br/>
<br/>
"Oh, I just wondered what little rodent was tracking blood all over the island." A woman-thing stepped out of the shadows, she wore a long dress and…<br/>
<br/>
'Oh no, she dead-thing!' Scritchet felt chills run down his spine as he caught a glimpse of the elongated fangs that she hid behind a silvery fan.<br/>
<br/>
Using his tail to help, he leaped at her in the standard Eschin dash, spinning himself around to become a whirling ball of blades and death.<br/>
<br/>
Almost casually, she swatted him out of the air with a strength that should be impossible for her lithe form. He crashed into the wall, splitting his teeth on the impact and tasting blood in his mouth.<br/>
<br/>
Before he could even regain his senses, he felt clawed fingers wrap around his throat. He tried to go for his daggers, but they were nowhere near him, and he was pinned to the wall as she brought him up to her face, a ghastly thing of twisted flesh that seemed wholly unnatural up close.<br/>
<br/>
"Look into my eyes, little rat."<br/>
<br/>
He tried everything he could to not do exactly what she said, but she slammed him into the wall again, and just for an instant his gaze met those burning red orbs.<br/>
<br/>
It was the last thing he would ever see.<br/>
_____________________________________________________<br/>
<br/>
Sheherazzad, or at least the vampiress who went by that name at the moment, watched dispassionately as her slaves filled in the small cave with dirt and fallen lumber, covering up the evidence of the Skaven's presence, and their intriguing device.<br/>
<br/>
Oh certainly, she could perform the same fear of long-distance communication through magic, but it was still a new factor that the Skaven of Clan Skryre were capable of the same, one she would have to inform her Queen about at the first possible opportunity. Still, its importance was trivial in comparison to the other intrigued this island presented.<br/>
<br/>
Pirates, Skaven, Dwarves, and even some of her distant kin, all mixed together in a colossal and uneasy status quo. All of them trying to secure, or perhaps to chase after knowledge of the Von Carstein heir who had gone running off into the sunset, possibly with one of the largest stores of Warpstone that had ever fallen to earth.<br/>
<br/>
She bit out a laugh, scratching the head of her newest pet, his zombified rat-pelt soft under her claws. To think that she had simply come here as a vacation! Centuries of minor political intrigues and deductions in Araby, all to wander into this mess on a well-earned break. The world truly was strange.<br/>
<br/>
Still, while her Queen would certainly want to hear of all this, there was the problem of the Skaven to contend with. The Sisterhood had worked long and hard to ensure a permanent civil war between the rat-men, one egged on by their own nature as much as any poisoned words from the Silver Pinnacle. If Skryre, however unlikely, managed to actually succeed in their attempts to seize the rumored Warpstone, it would upset the balance of power between the Four Great Skaven Clans, tipping the board such that much effort would be required to stabilize it.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps? Yes, that would be elegant, a few words let slip here, a hint or two dropped about the reason for the Skaven presence. The so-called Fraternity vampires were clever, in a common sort of way, they would no doubt use their surprisingly vast knowledge to quickly guess that the Skaven were pursuing their father, and once that seed was there…<br/>
<br/>
Ah, here she was, acting like she was a junior sister again, tossing whole nations into catastrophic wars just to see what would happen. It was refreshing, not needing to plot three or four centuries ahead, even if it seemed a bit childish.<br/>
<br/>
But then again, what was more fun than watching children fight amongst themselves?<br/>
<br/>
She was on vacation after all.<br/>

"My, my, my, so the little pirate made off with enough Warpstone to have a fleet sent after him."<br/>
<br/>
Scritchet froze as a woman-thing's voice echoed through his little cave. He drew out his daggers at once, sniffing the air. "Who there? How you find me-me!?!" He demanded, spinning his daggers in his hands.<br/>
<br/>
"Oh, I just wondered what little rodent was tracking blood all over the island." A woman-thing stepped out of the shadows, she wore a long dress and…<br/>
<br/>
'Oh no, she dead-thing!' Scritchet felt chills run down his spine as he caught a glimpse of the elongated fangs that she hid behind a silvery fan.<br/>
<br/>
Using his tail to help, he leaped at her in the standard Eschin dash, spinning himself around to become a whirling ball of blades and death.<br/>
<br/>
Almost casually, she swatted him out of the air with a strength that should be impossible for her lithe form. He crashed into the wall, splitting his teeth on the impact and tasting blood in his mouth.<br/>
<br/>
Before he could even regain his senses, he felt clawed fingers wrap around his throat. He tried to go for his daggers, but they were nowhere near him, and he was pinned to the wall as she brought him up to her face, a ghastly thing of twisted flesh that seemed wholly unnatural up close.<br/>
<br/>
"Look into my eyes, little rat."<br/>
<br/>
He tried everything he could to not do exactly what she said, but she slammed him into the wall again, and just for an instant his gaze met those burning red orbs.<br/>
<br/>
It was the last thing he would ever see.<br/>

<br/>
Sheherazzad, or at least the vampiress who went by that name at the moment, watched dispassionately as her slaves filled in the small cave with dirt and fallen lumber, covering up the evidence of the Skaven's presence, and their intriguing device.<br/>
<br/>
Oh certainly, she could perform the same fear of long-distance communication through magic, but it was still a new factor that the Skaven of Clan Skryre were capable of the same, one she would have to inform her Queen about at the first possible opportunity. Still, its importance was trivial in comparison to the other intrigued this island presented.<br/>
<br/>
Pirates, Skaven, Dwarves, and even some of her distant kin, all mixed together in a colossal and uneasy status quo. All of them trying to secure, or perhaps to chase after knowledge of the Von Carstein heir who had gone running off into the sunset, possibly with one of the largest stores of Warpstone that had ever fallen to earth.<br/>
<br/>
She bit out a laugh, scratching the head of her newest pet, his zombified rat-pelt soft under her claws. To think that she had simply come here as a vacation! Centuries of minor political intrigues and deductions in Araby, all to wander into this mess on a well-earned break. The world truly was strange.<br/>
<br/>
Still, while her Queen would certainly want to hear of all this, there was the problem of the Skaven to contend with. The Sisterhood had worked long and hard to ensure a permanent civil war between the rat-men, one egged on by their own nature as much as any poisoned words from the Silver Pinnacle. If Skryre, however unlikely, managed to actually succeed in their attempts to seize the rumored Warpstone, it would upset the balance of power between the Four Great Skaven Clans, tipping the board such that much effort would be required to stabilize it.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps? Yes, that would be elegant, a few words let slip here, a hint or two dropped about the reason for the Skaven presence. The so-called Fraternity vampires were clever, in a common sort of way, they would no doubt use their surprisingly vast knowledge to quickly guess that the Skaven were pursuing their father, and once that seed was there…<br/>
<br/>
Ah, here she was, acting like she was a junior sister again, tossing whole nations into catastrophic wars just to see what would happen. It was refreshing, not needing to plot three or four centuries ahead, even if it seemed a bit childish.<br/>
<br/>
But then again, what was more fun than watching children fight amongst themselves?<br/>
<br/>
She was on vacation after all.<br/>
_________________________________________________________</div>, 'Island of Salt and Spray 1': <div class="bbWrapper">"After it!"<br/>
<br/>
"Don't let that Rat Get Away!"<br/>
<br/>
Scritchet ducked under a high railing as the Beard things chased after him, their rifles cracking the air and sending lead flying after him.<br/>
<br/>
He was hurt, bad-bad. The man-thing had managed to put a shot into his left thigh, and he was only managing to scurry away by virtue of supporting it with his tail.<br/>
<br/>
With a heave, he threw himself out the main gate to where the beard things were all still focused on clearing out the slave corpses. The alert hadn't gotten out from inside the big fortress yet, that was good-good. They didn't seem to notice as he scrabbled up the front of a big beard-thing statue.<br/>
<br/>
He paused for a moment to consider the merits of using the statues eyesocket as a toilet before a shout came up from the deck far below and heavy lead shots started ricocheting off of the stone around him.<br/>
<br/>
A glance back told him that the very irate dwarf engineer who had known the pirate thing's admiral had hobbled all the way out onto the deck and started shooting at him.<br/>
<br/>
'die-die already!' he cursed mentally as he swung up to another section, hoping the stone would shelter him from the hail of fire. Clan Skryre had assured him that the poison in that smoke bomb was enough to kill beard things, but maybe they were just cheap liars.<br/>
<br/>
'they pay good warpstone at least.' Scritchet grumbled as he scrambled into the steaming jungle. The self-proclaimed Lord's of Skavenblight had been his backers on this little mission, apparently by some means they had discovered that the vampire Karl had extracted unholy amounts of Warpstone from the city of Mordheim after flooding the warrens there. The Warlock engineers were pretty sure that he still had it, and wanted it to give them an advantage in the endless civil wars between Pestilens, Moulder, and Skryre.<br/>
<br/>
Scritchet ducked into the tiny cave that Mitchet and he had set up as a home base. Mitchet wasn't back yet, and given that he had been supposed to kill the hunt-thing…<br/>
<br/>
Well, more pay for Scritchet.<br/>
<br/>
With a few flicks to some levers on the big brass box that they had brought with them, and a kick to the antenna, which started spitting green lightning between its prongs, the so-called farsqueaker flared to life.<br/>
<br/>
"This-this is Scritchet, reporting from Sartosa with spy-spy information, for Ikit Claw-Claw!" Scritchet took the opportunity to glance down at his leg. The wound didn't look good. He grabbed some bandages and quickly began to wrap it while he waited for a response on the farsqueaker.<br/>
<br/>
"Ikit Claw is busy-working right now, tell me your message and I take it to him." A high pitched voice, not Ikit, responded.<br/>
<br/>
"Do you think me-me fool? Take to Claw or I no talk-talk." Scritchet replied angrily. Didn't they know this was urgent?<br/>
<br/>
"You no talk to Claw Claw unless you talk to me-m-auork" the Rat's words were cut off with a choking sound, followed by an electrical tearing noise.<br/>
<br/>
"This Ikit, agent Scritchet report, where is the Pi-pirate!" The deeper voiced Skaven ordered immediately over the dying gasps of the previous talker.<br/>
<br/>
"Sir, Beard things think he sail-sailed into Maelstrom, big spooky whirlpool, all pirate things fear-fear it."<br/>
<br/>
"..." There was an uncomfortable silence over the line for a few long moments, punctuated only by the last dying gasps of his previous conversation partner. Finally, Ikit spoke again. "That's Mad-mad and sounds exactly like that dead-thing. I will send a big fleet-fleet. With that much Warpstone Skryre will win-win big war."<br/>
<br/>
"And Eshin will get pay?"<br/>
<br/>
"Yes-yes, Eshin will get much-much warpstone for information. You done well-well." Ikit growled, sounding rather displeased with the necessity of actually paying Eschin anything. "I will speak-squeak with Deathmaster."<br/>
<br/>
"Good-good." Scritchet nodded. As the successful agent, Eschin would give him much warpstone, and he would be promoted up the line of assassins, perhaps even to master rank if Deathmaster felt generous-kind!<br/>
<br/>
"I have Fleet-fleet to prepare, warpstone to find-find, go back to Eshin hold and you will get your pay," Ikit said, before the line cut out and the farsqueaker in front of him spontaneously combusted.<br/>
<br/>
Scritchet grinned, he could already taste the warpstone, all he had to do was get off this island and…<br/>

"My, my, my, so the little pirate made off with enough Warpstone to have a fleet sent after him."<br/>

The alert hadn't gotten out from inside the big fortress yet, that was good-good. They didn't seem to notice as he scrabbled up the front of a big beard-thing statue.<br/>
<br/>
He paused for a moment to consider the merits of using the statues eyesocket as a toilet before a shout came up from the deck far below and heavy lead shots started ricocheting off of the stone around him.<br/>
<br/>
A glance back told him that the very irate dwarf engineer who had known the pirate thing's admiral had hobbled all the way out onto the deck and started shooting at him.<br/>
<br/>
'die-die already!' he cursed mentally as he swung up to another section, hoping the stone would shelter him from the hail of fire. Clan Skryre had assured him that the poison in that smoke bomb was enough to kill beard things, but maybe they were just cheap liars.<br/>
<br/>
'they pay good warpstone at least.' Scritchet grumbled as he scrambled into the steaming jungle. The self-proclaimed Lord's of Skavenblight had been his backers on this little mission, apparently by some means they had discovered that the vampire Karl had extracted unholy amounts of Warpstone from the city of Mordheim after flooding the warrens there. The Warlock engineers were pretty sure that he still had it, and wanted it to give them an advantage in the endless civil wars between Pestilens, Moulder, and Skryre.<br/>
<br/>
Scritchet ducked into the tiny cave that Mitchet and he had set up as a home base. Mitchet wasn't back yet, and given that he had been supposed to kill the hunt-thing…<br/>
<br/>
Well, more pay for Scritchet.<br/>
<br/>
With a few flicks to some levers on the big brass box that they had brought with them, and a kick to the antenna, which started spitting green lightning between its prongs, the so-called farsqueaker flared to life.<br/>
<br/>
"This-this is Scritchet, reporting from Sartosa with spy-spy information, for Ikit Claw-Claw!" Scritchet took the opportunity to glance down at his leg. The wound didn't look good. He grabbed some bandages and quickly began to wrap it while he waited for a response on the farsqueaker.<br/>
<br/>
"Ikit Claw is busy-working right now, tell me your message and I take it to him." A high pitched voice, not Ikit, responded.<br/>
<br/>
"Do you think me-me fool? Take to Claw or I no talk-talk." Scritchet replied angrily. Didn't they know this was urgent?<br/>
<br/>
"You no talk to Claw Claw unless you talk to me-m-auork" the Rat's words were cut off with a choking sound, followed by an electrical tearing noise.<br/>
<br/>
"This Ikit, agent Scritchet report, where is the Pi-pirate!" The deeper voiced Skaven ordered immediately over the dying gasps of the previous talker.<br/>
<br/>
"Sir, Beard things think he sail-sailed into Maelstrom, big spooky whirlpool, all pirate things fear-fear it."<br/>
<br/>
"..." There was an uncomfortable silence over the line for a few long moments, punctuated only by the last dying gasps of his previous conversation partner. Finally, Ikit spoke again. "That's Mad-mad and sounds exactly like that dead-thing. I will send a big fleet-fleet. With that much Warpstone Skryre will win-win big war."<br/>
<br/>
"And Eshin will get pay?"<br/>
<br/>
"Yes-yes, Eshin will get much-much warpstone for information. You done well-well." Ikit growled, sounding rather displeased with the necessity of actually paying Eschin anything. "I will speak-squeak with Deathmaster."<br/>
<br/>
"Good-good." Scritchet nodded. As the successful agent, Eschin would give him much warpstone, and he would be promoted up the line of assassins, perhaps even to master rank if Deathmaster felt generous-kind!<br/>
<br/>
"I have Fleet-fleet to prepare, warpstone to find-find, go back to Eshin hold and you will get your pay," Ikit said, before the line cut out and the farsqueaker in front of him spontaneously combusted.<br/>
<br/>
Scritchet grinned, he could already taste the warpstone, all he had to do was get off this island and…<br/>
<br/>
"My, my, my, so the little pirate made off with enough Warpstone to have a fleet sent after him."<br/>
<br/>
Scritchet froze as a woman-thing's voice echoed through his little cave. He drew out his daggers at once, sniffing the air. "Who there? How you find me-me!?!" He demanded, spinning his daggers in his hands.<br/>
<br/>
"Oh, I just wondered what little rodent was tracking blood all over the island." A woman-thing stepped out of the shadows, she wore a long dress and…<br/>
<br/>
'Oh no, she dead-thing!' Scritchet felt chills run down his spine as he caught a glimpse of the elongated fangs that she hid behind a silvery fan.<br/>
<br/>
Using his tail to help, he leaped at her in the standard Eschin dash, spinning himself around to become a whirling ball of blades and death.<br/>
<br/>
Almost casually, she swatted him out of the air with a strength that should be impossible for her lithe form. He crashed into the wall, splitting his teeth on the impact and tasting blood in his mouth.<br/>
<br/>
Before he could even regain his senses, he felt clawed fingers wrap around his throat. He tried to go for his daggers, but they were nowhere near him, and he was pinned to the wall as she brought him up to her face, a ghastly thing of twisted flesh that seemed wholly unnatural up close.<br/>
<br/>
"Look into my eyes, little rat."<br/>
<br/>
He tried everything he could to not do exactly what she said, but she slammed him into the wall again, and just for an instant his gaze met those burning red orbs.<br/>
<br/>
It was the last thing he would ever see.<br/>
_____________________________________________________<br/>
<br/>
Sheherazzad, or at least the vampiress who went by that name at the moment, watched dispassionately as her slaves filled in the small cave with dirt and fallen lumber, covering up the evidence of the Skaven's presence, and their intriguing device.<br/>
<br/>
Oh certainly, she could perform the same fear of long-distance communication through magic, but it was still a new factor that the Skaven of Clan Skryre were capable of the same, one she would have to inform her Queen about at the first possible opportunity. Still, its importance was trivial in comparison to the other intrigued this island presented.<br/>
<br/>
Pirates, Skaven, Dwarves, and even some of her distant kin, all mixed together in a colossal and uneasy status quo. All of them trying to secure, or perhaps to chase after knowledge of the Von Carstein heir who had gone running off into the sunset, possibly with one of the largest stores of Warpstone that had ever fallen to earth.<br/>
<br/>
She bit out a laugh, scratching the head of her newest pet, his zombified rat-pelt soft under her claws. To think that she had simply come here as a vacation! Centuries of minor political intrigues and deductions in Araby, all to wander into this mess on a well-earned break. The world truly was strange.<br/>
<br/>
Still, while her Queen would certainly want to hear of all this, there was the problem of the Skaven to contend with. The Sisterhood had worked long and hard to ensure a permanent civil war between the rat-men, one egged on by their own nature as much as any poisoned words from the Silver Pinnacle. If Skryre, however unlikely, managed to actually succeed in their attempts to seize the rumored Warpstone, it would upset the balance of power between the Four Great Skaven Clans, tipping the board such that much effort would be required to stabilize it.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps? Yes, that would be elegant, a few words let slip here, a hint or two dropped about the reason for the Skaven presence. The so-called Fraternity vampires were clever, in a common sort of way, they would no doubt use their surprisingly vast knowledge to quickly guess that the Skaven were pursuing their father, and once that seed was there…<br/>
<br/>
Ah, here she was, acting like she was a junior sister again, tossing whole nations into catastrophic wars just to see what would happen. It was refreshing, not needing to plot three or four centuries ahead, even if it seemed a bit childish.<br/>
<br/>
But then again, what was more fun than watching children fight amongst themselves?<br/>
<br/>
She was on vacation after all.<br/>

Scritchet ducked under a high railing as the Beard things chased after him, their rifles cracking the air and sending lead flying after him.<br/>

_________________________________________________________</div>}), (2, {'Island of Salt and Spray 7': <div class="bbWrapper">The spire was fearfully high above the ground of the undersea kingdom, and the stairs seemingly designed to be slick and treacherous, constantly damp with algae and sloping at odd angles seemingly at random.<br/>
<br/>
If he had not seen so much of his father already, Johann would have called Karl a fool for making the ascent. What man would not be satisfied with riches, or with the troves of powerful items below? What could drive someone to risk everything for still greater profits? Perhaps only the gods of this place knew, but for now, at least they held their tongues, and Johann continued on behind the elder vampire until they reached a first great landing on the spiral stair that encircled the spire. <br/>
<br/>
The platform was of red coral, like the rest of the great temple, but built into the tower was a great opening, revealing a chamber within. Johann did not look within though, as his eyes were instead drawn to the colossal edifice which sat above it. It seemed like the skull of a man, or perhaps a giant, only that even for those I'll it would have been far too large, bleached bone rising from the coral-like a tooth from a gum. Johann looked to Karl for explanation and found his father stroking his chin and staring up appreciatively at the skull.<br/>
<br/>
"I had wondered, but I suppose that's as fine a way as any to bury their dead." The old Vampire smiled slightly. Karl turned to face Johann, his smirk morphing into a grin of excitement. "Tell me lad, who do you think built this place exactly?"<br/>
<br/>
"Er, I…" Johann hadn't given it much thought everything had been moving so quickly, still, the skull was a clue and he wouldn't miss it. "Was it the giants?"<br/>
<br/>
"The Sea Giants to be precise, the smallest of the true giant breeds." The Captain cackled, and Johann looked at the skull if they were the smallest then- "of course even the smallest true giants would dwarf the inbred morons that roam the world today. The Sky Titans have long since past to history, and from what I gather so too have fallen their brethren in Albion, but ah, these folks were the poorest of them. Their Atlantis now drowned here under the waves." Karl paused for a moment, "very poetic, ah, but they're not what we're here for either, and if my reading's right that Rune Axe isn't worth our time either."<br/>
<br/>
Johann blinked, then looked down between the jaws of the skull to the chamber within, a great ax of Dwarven make sat up on top of a plinth of thick grey stone.<br/>
<br/>
"It has a map to Karak Zorn on it I think. An artifact worthy of expeditions to be sure, but not one to delay our quest. Onwards and upwards my lad, onwards and upwards." Karl chuckled, sounding very impressed with himself, though to be honest Johann had no idea what this Karak Zorn place was, only that it sounded Dwarfish.<br/>
<br/>
The Coral path led them further up the slippery slope, made moreso by the occasional liquidated ratmen on the stairs that set his nostrils afire with the smell of fresh blood, still, he heeded his father's warning and restrained himself for now. Who knew what foul diseases the rats might be carrying with them?<br/>
<br/>
The spire had many more bones built into it as they marched ever closer to the blue light at the top of the undersea kingdom, though chambers were only built into the skulls, each held some wondrous artifact or another, things of strange forms and mighty power, though Johann could hardly tell them apart from the items that filled the caverns below. Karl still paused to inform him of their nature. To each, he gave a name, though all sounded foreign to him. "The Dragon Helm of Caledor the first,  A dozen Golden Prophecies of the Old Ones-A Heavy Bolter?"<br/>
<br/>
Karl had stopped at the last one and burst into a fit of hysterical laughter at the sight of what must have been the most complex cannon that Johann had ever seen. "Yahahahahar, ah, I suppose the warp works in mysterious ways, but it's not what we came here for. Follow behind me now it's steep towards the top, and I spy there's but one treasure left between us and our destination." <br/>
<br/>
Johann looked up the slope over his father's shoulder and saw that he was right, the last of the great skulls, and the last of the platforms was but a few steps ahead of them, and from its brow was carved a stairway that went straight to the peak of the great coral monument, rising into the waters that seemed suspended so closely now above their heads, up to the very firmament where that strange blue sun sat suspended.<br/>
<br/>
Johann moved to rest but nearly bumped into his father, as Karl had stopped dead in his tracks, his eyes fixed upon the last artifact. Johann could see veins rise on his skin. Johann, casually looked past him into the skull, though at first, he could barely see the treasure that had paused the captain, save for a faint glow. As his gaze sharpened though he could see that it was a collection of simple keys, nearly transparent and softly glowing with a faint light.<br/>
<br/>
Karl stepped forward abruptly though, marching directly between the jaws and looking down on the small stone plinth that sat within, before sitting down on the ground before it without saying a word.<br/>
<br/>
"Umm…" Johann subconsciously let out, only to be ferociously shushed. <br/>
<br/>
"Quiet lad, I'm contemplating here." The elder vampire snapped, "this little bauble presents new information and opportunities with it."<br/>
<br/>
"You had said not to be tempted by anything but the spire."<br/>
<br/>
"And I was damn right, but I'm considering the weight of my inheritance." Johann spied Karl draw out a ring a mottled thing of black iron with a great ruby sat into its center. "This ring was made by the hand of Nagash. A tool to enslave the vampires of Lhamia. My Father, Vlad, turned its power against its maker, and it let him cheat death many times. It grants the truest form of immortality known to Vampires, but it is not infallible. It was stolen from my father, and I never would have recovered it save for Cassandora and her omens. Its value is, incalculable." The Elder Vampire said slowly, placing it on the Altar, before slowly picking up the nearly transparent keys. He put on the simple necklace and tucked it into his shirt. "And yet I value the possibility more, and I have not come this far by taking the safer option." <br/>
<br/>
"What are the keys?" Johann asked, wondering what could possibly be more valuable than cheating death.<br/>
<br/>
"The fewer who know, the better. I may tell you once they've served their purpose." Karl straightened his jacket and pulled back his pale hair before making the final ascent towards the waters above. "For now come, we have our true prize to claim, and I doubt that the ocean will let us have it easily."<br/>
___________________________________________________________</div>, 'The Pit in the Sea 1': <div class="bbWrapper">The spire was fearfully high above the ground of the undersea kingdom, and the stairs seemingly designed to be slick and treacherous, constantly damp with algae and sloping at odd angles seemingly at random.<br/>
<br/>
If he had not seen so much of his father already, Johann would have called Karl a fool for making the ascent. What man would not be satisfied with riches, or with the troves of powerful items below? What could drive someone to risk everything for still greater profits? Perhaps only the gods of this place knew, but for now, at least they held their tongues, and Johann continued on behind the elder vampire until they reached a first great landing on the spiral stair that encircled the spire. <br/>
<br/>
The platform was of red coral, like the rest of the great temple, but built into the tower was a great opening, revealing a chamber within. Johann did not look within though, as his eyes were instead drawn to the colossal edifice which sat above it. It seemed like the skull of a man, or perhaps a giant, only that even for those I'll it would have been far too large, bleached bone rising from the coral-like a tooth from a gum. Johann looked to Karl for explanation and found his father stroking his chin and staring up appreciatively at the skull.<br/>
<br/>
"I had wondered, but I suppose that's as fine a way as any to bury their dead." The old Vampire smiled slightly. Karl turned to face Johann, his smirk morphing into a grin of excitement. "Tell me lad, who do you think built this place exactly?"<br/>
<br/>
"Er, I…" Johann hadn't given it much thought everything had been moving so quickly, still, the skull was a clue and he wouldn't miss it. "Was it the giants?"<br/>
<br/>
"The Sea Giants to be precise, the smallest of the true giant breeds." The Captain cackled, and Johann looked at the skull if they were the smallest then- "of course even the smallest true giants would dwarf the inbred morons that roam the world today. The Sky Titans have long since past to history, and from what I gather so too have fallen their brethren in Albion, but ah, these folks were the poorest of them. Their Atlantis now drowned here under the waves." Karl paused for a moment, "very poetic, ah, but they're not what we're here for either, and if my reading's right that Rune Axe isn't worth our time either."<br/>
<br/>
Johann blinked, then looked down between the jaws of the skull to the chamber within, a great ax of Dwarven make sat up on top of a plinth of thick grey stone.<br/>
<br/>
"It has a map to Karak Zorn on it I think. An artifact worthy of expeditions to be sure, but not one to delay our quest. Onwards and upwards my lad, onwards and upwards." Karl chuckled, sounding very impressed with himself, though to be honest Johann had no idea what this Karak Zorn place was, only that it sounded Dwarfish.<br/>
<br/>
The Coral path led them further up the slippery slope, made moreso by the occasional liquidated ratmen on the stairs that set his nostrils afire with the smell of fresh blood, still, he heeded his father's warning and restrained himself for now. Who knew what foul diseases the rats might be carrying with them?<br/>
<br/>
The spire had many more bones built into it as they marched ever closer to the blue light at the top of the undersea kingdom, though chambers were only built into the skulls, each held some wondrous artifact or another, things of strange forms and mighty power, though Johann could hardly tell them apart from the items that filled the caverns below. Karl still paused to inform him of their nature. To each, he gave a name, though all sounded foreign to him. "The Dragon Helm of Caledor the first,  A dozen Golden Prophecies of the Old Ones-A Heavy Bolter?"<br/>
<br/>
Karl had stopped at the last one and burst into a fit of hysterical laughter at the sight of what must have been the most complex cannon that Johann had ever seen. "Yahahahahar, ah, I suppose the warp works in mysterious ways, but it's not what we came here for. Follow behind me now it's steep towards the top, and I spy there's but one treasure left between us and our destination." <br/>
<br/>
Johann looked up the slope over his father's shoulder and saw that he was right, the last of the great skulls, and the last of the platforms was but a few steps ahead of them, and from its brow was carved a stairway that went straight to the peak of the great coral monument, rising into the waters that seemed suspended so closely now above their heads, up to the very firmament where that strange blue sun sat suspended.<br/>
<br/>
Johann moved to rest but nearly bumped into his father, as Karl had stopped dead in his tracks, his eyes fixed upon the last artifact. Johann could see veins rise on his skin. Johann, casually looked past him into the skull, though at first, he could barely see the treasure that had paused the captain, save for a faint glow. As his gaze sharpened though he could see that it was a collection of simple keys, nearly transparent and softly glowing with a faint light.<br/>
<br/>
Karl stepped forward abruptly though, marching directly between the jaws and looking down on the small stone plinth that sat within, before sitting down on the ground before it without saying a word.<br/>
<br/>
"Umm…" Johann subconsciously let out, only to be ferociously shushed. <br/>
<br/>
"Quiet lad, I'm contemplating here." The elder vampire snapped, "this little bauble presents new information and opportunities with it."<br/>
<br/>
"You had said not to be tempted by anything but the spire."<br/>
<br/>
"And I was damn right, but I'm considering the weight of my inheritance." Johann spied Karl draw out a ring a mottled thing of black iron with a great ruby sat into its center.

Johann moved to rest but nearly bumped into his father, as Karl had stopped dead in his tracks, his eyes fixed upon the last artifact. Johann could see veins rise on his skin. Johann, casually looked past him into the skull, though at first, he could barely see the treasure that had paused the captain, save for a faint glow. As his gaze sharpened though he could see that it was a collection of simple keys, nearly transparent and softly glowing with a faint light.<br/>
<br/>
Karl stepped forward abruptly though, marching directly between the jaws and looking down on the small stone plinth that sat within, before sitting down on the ground before it without saying a word.<br/>
<br/>
"Umm…" Johann subconsciously let out, only to be ferociously shushed. <br/>
<br/>
"Quiet lad, I'm contemplating here." The elder vampire snapped, "this little bauble presents new information and opportunities with it."<br/>
<br/>
"You had said not to be tempted by anything but the spire."<br/>
<br/>
"And I was damn right, but I'm considering the weight of my inheritance." Johann spied Karl draw out a ring a mottled thing of black iron with a great ruby sat into its center. "This ring was made by the hand of Nagash. A tool to enslave the vampires of Lhamia. My Father, Vlad, turned its power against its maker, and it let him cheat death many times. It grants the truest form of immortality known to Vampires, but it is not infallible. It was stolen from my father, and I never would have recovered it save for Cassandora and her omens. Its value is, incalculable." The Elder Vampire said slowly, placing it on the Altar, before slowly picking up the nearly transparent keys. He put on the simple necklace and tucked it into his shirt. "And yet I value the possibility more, and I have not come this far by taking the safer option." <br/>
<br/>
"What are the keys?" Johann asked, wondering what could possibly be more valuable than cheating death.<br/>
<br/>
"The fewer who know, the better. I may tell you once they've served their purpose." Karl straightened his jacket and pulled back his pale hair before making the final ascent towards the waters above. "For now come, we have our true prize to claim, and I doubt that the ocean will let us have it easily."<br/>
___________________________________________________________</div>, 'On the Tides 3': <div class="bbWrapper">The spire was fearfully high above the ground of the undersea kingdom, and the stairs seemingly designed to be slick and treacherous, constantly damp with algae and sloping at odd angles seemingly at random.<br/>
<br/>
If he had not seen so much of his father already, Johann would have called Karl a fool for making the ascent. What man would not be satisfied with riches, or with the troves of powerful items below? What could drive someone to risk everything for still greater profits? Perhaps only the gods of this place knew, but for now, at least they held their tongues, and Johann continued on behind the elder vampire until they reached a first great landing on the spiral stair that encircled the spire. <br/>
<br/>
The platform was of red coral, like the rest of the great temple, but built into the tower was a great opening, revealing a chamber within. Johann did not look within though, as his eyes were instead drawn to the colossal edifice which sat above it. It seemed like the skull of a man, or perhaps a giant, only that even for those I'll it would have been far too large, bleached bone rising from the coral-like a tooth from a gum. Johann looked to Karl for explanation and found his father stroking his chin and staring up appreciatively at the skull.<br/>
<br/>
"I had wondered, but I suppose that's as fine a way as any to bury their dead." The old Vampire smiled slightly. Karl turned to face Johann, his smirk morphing into a grin of excitement. "Tell me lad, who do you think built this place exactly?"<br/>
<br/>
"Er, I…" Johann hadn't given it much thought everything had been moving so quickly, still, the skull was a clue and he wouldn't miss it. "Was it the giants?"<br/>
<br/>
"The Sea Giants to be precise, the smallest of the true giant breeds." The Captain cackled, and Johann looked at the skull if they were the smallest then- "of course even the smallest true giants would dwarf the inbred morons that roam the world today. The Sky Titans have long since past to history, and from what I gather so too have fallen their brethren in Albion, but ah, these folks were the poorest of them. Their Atlantis now drowned here under the waves." Karl paused for a moment, "very poetic, ah, but they're not what we're here for either, and if my reading's right that Rune Axe isn't worth our time either."<br/>
<br/>
Johann blinked, then looked down between the jaws of the skull to the chamber within, a great ax of Dwarven make sat up on top of a plinth of thick grey stone.<br/>
<br/>
"It has a map to Karak Zorn on it I think. An artifact worthy of expeditions to be sure, but not one to delay our quest. Onwards and upwards my lad, onwards and upwards." Karl chuckled, sounding very impressed with himself, though to be honest Johann had no idea what this Karak Zorn place was, only that it sounded Dwarfish.<br/>
<br/>
The Coral path led them further up the slippery slope, made moreso by the occasional liquidated ratmen on the stairs that set his nostrils afire with the smell of fresh blood, still, he heeded his father's warning and restrained himself for now. Who knew what foul diseases the rats might be carrying with them?<br/>
<br/>
The spire had many more bones built into it as they marched ever closer to the blue light at the top of the undersea kingdom, though chambers were only built into the skulls, each held some wondrous artifact or another, things of strange forms and mighty power, though Johann could hardly tell them apart from the items that filled the caverns below. Karl still paused to inform him of their nature. To each, he gave a name, though all sounded foreign to him. "The Dragon Helm of Caledor the first,  A dozen Golden Prophecies of the Old Ones-A Heavy Bolter?"<br/>
<br/>
Karl had stopped at the last one and burst into a fit of hysterical laughter at the sight of what must have been the most complex cannon that Johann had ever seen. "Yahahahahar, ah, I suppose the warp works in mysterious ways, but it's not what we came here for. Follow behind me now it's steep towards the top, and I spy there's but one treasure left between us and our destination." <br/>
<br/>
Johann looked up the slope over his father's shoulder and saw that he was right, the last of the great skulls, and the last of the platforms was but a few steps ahead of them, and from its brow was carved a stairway that went straight to the peak of the great coral monument, rising into the waters that seemed suspended so closely now above their heads, up to the very firmament where that strange blue sun sat suspended.<br/>
